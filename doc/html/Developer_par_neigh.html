<h1><span class="section-number">4.4.3. </span>Neighbor lists<a class="headerlink" href="#neighbor-lists" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>To compute forces efficiently, each processor creates a Verlet-style
neighbor list which enumerates all pairs of atoms <em>i,j</em> (<em>i</em> = owned,
<em>j</em> = owned or ghost) with separation less than the applicable neighbor
list cutoff distance.  In LAMMPS, the neighbor lists are stored in a
multiple-page data structure; each page is a contiguous chunk of memory
which stores vectors of neighbor atoms <em>j</em> for many <em>i</em> atoms.  This
allows pages to be incrementally allocated or deallocated in blocks as
needed.  Neighbor lists typically consume the most memory of any data
structure in LAMMPS.  The neighbor list is rebuilt (from scratch) once
every few timesteps, then used repeatedly each step for force or other
computations.  The neighbor cutoff distance is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_n = R_f +
\Delta_s\)</span>, where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_f\)</span> is the (largest) force cutoff defined by
the interatomic potential for computing short-range pairwise or manybody
forces and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta_s\)</span> is a “skin” distance that allows the list to
be used for multiple steps assuming that atoms do not move very far
between consecutive time steps.  Typically, the code triggers
reneighboring when any atom has moved half the skin distance since the
last reneighboring; this and other options of the neighbor list rebuild
can be adjusted with the <a class="reference internal" href="neigh_modify.html"><span class="doc">neigh_modify</span></a> command.</p>
<p>On steps when reneighboring is performed, atoms which have moved outside
their owning processor’s subdomain are first migrated to new processors
via communication.  Periodic boundary conditions are also (only)
enforced on these steps to ensure each atom is re-assigned to the
correct processor.  After migration, the atoms owned by each processor
are stored in a contiguous vector.  Periodically, each processor
spatially sorts owned atoms within its vector to reorder it for improved
cache efficiency in force computations and neighbor list building.  For
that, atoms are spatially binned and then reordered so that atoms in the
same bin are adjacent in the vector.  Atom sorting can be disabled or
its settings modified with the <a class="reference internal" href="atom_modify.html"><span class="doc">atom_modify</span></a> command.</p>

<p>A 2d simulation subdomain (thick black line) and the corresponding
ghost atom cutoff region (dashed blue line) for both orthogonal
(left) and triclinic (right) domains.  A regular grid of neighbor
bins (thin lines) overlays the entire simulation domain and need not
align with subdomain boundaries; only the portion overlapping the
augmented subdomain is shown.  In the triclinic case, it overlaps the
bounding box of the tilted rectangle.  The blue- and red-shaded bins
represent a stencil of bins searched to find neighbors of a particular
atom (black dot).</p>

</figure>
<p>To build a local neighbor list in linear time, the simulation domain is
overlaid (conceptually) with a regular 3d (or 2d) grid of neighbor bins,
as shown in the <a class="reference internal" href="#neighbor-stencil"><span class="std std-ref">neighbor list stencils</span></a> figure for 2d models and a
single MPI processor’s subdomain.  Each processor stores a set of
neighbor bins which overlap its subdomain, extended by the neighbor
cutoff distance <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_n\)</span>.  As illustrated, the bins need not align
with processor boundaries; an integer number in each dimension is fit to
the size of the entire simulation box.</p>
<p>Most often, LAMMPS builds what is called a “half” neighbor list where
each <em>i,j</em> neighbor pair is stored only once, with either atom <em>i</em> or
<em>j</em> as the central atom.  The build can be done efficiently by using a
pre-computed “stencil” of bins around a central origin bin which
contains the atom whose neighbors are being searched for.  A stencil
is simply a list of integer offsets in <em>x,y,z</em> of nearby bins
surrounding the origin bin which are close enough to contain any
neighbor atom <em>j</em> within a distance <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_n\)</span> from any atom <em>i</em> in the
origin bin.  Note that for a half neighbor list, the stencil can be
asymmetric, since each atom only need store half its nearby neighbors.</p>
<p>These stencils are illustrated in the figure for a half list and a bin
size of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{1}{2} R_n\)</span>.  There are 13 red+blue stencil bins in
2d (for the orthogonal case, 15 for triclinic).  In 3d there would be
63, 13 in the plane of bins that contain the origin bin and 25 in each
of the two planes above it in the <em>z</em> direction (75 for triclinic).  The
triclinic stencil has extra bins because the bins tile the bounding box
of the entire triclinic domain, and thus are not periodic with respect
to the simulation box itself.  The stencil and logic for determining
which <em>i,j</em> pairs to include in the neighbor list are altered slightly
to account for this.</p>
<p>To build a neighbor list, a processor first loops over its “owned” plus
“ghost” atoms and assigns each to a neighbor bin.  This uses an integer
vector to create a linked list of atom indices within each bin.  It then
performs a triply-nested loop over its owned atoms <em>i</em>, the stencil of
bins surrounding atom <em>i</em>’s bin, and the <em>j</em> atoms in each stencil bin
(including ghost atoms).  If the distance <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r_{ij} &lt; R_n\)</span>, then
atom <em>j</em> is added to the vector of atom <em>i</em>’s neighbors.</p>
<p>Here are additional details about neighbor list build options LAMMPS
supports:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The choice of bin size is an option; a size half of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_n\)</span> has
been found to be optimal for many typical cases.  Smaller bins incur
additional overhead to loop over; larger bins require more distance
calculations.  Note that for smaller bin sizes, the 2d stencil in the
figure would be of a more semicircular shape (hemispherical in 3d),
with bins near the corners of the square eliminated due to their
distance from the origin bin.</p></li>
<li><p>Depending on the interatomic potential(s) and other commands used in
an input script, multiple neighbor lists and stencils with different
attributes may be needed.  This includes lists with different cutoff
distances, e.g. for force computation versus occasional diagnostic
computations such as a radial distribution function, or for the
r-RESPA time integrator which can partition pairwise forces by
distance into subsets computed at different time intervals.  It
includes “full” lists (as opposed to half lists) where each <em>i,j</em> pair
appears twice, stored once with <em>i</em> and <em>j</em>, and which use a larger
symmetric stencil.  It also includes lists with partial enumeration of
ghost atom neighbors.  The full and ghost-atom lists are used by
various manybody interatomic potentials.  Lists may also use different
criteria for inclusion of a pairwise interaction.  Typically, this
simply depends only on the distance between two atoms and the cutoff
distance.  But for finite-size coarse-grained particles with
individual diameters (e.g. polydisperse granular particles), it can
also depend on the diameters of the two particles.</p></li>
<li><p>When using <a class="reference internal" href="pair_hybrid.html"><span class="doc">pair style hybrid</span></a> multiple sub-lists
of the master neighbor list for the full system need to be generated,
one for each sub-style, which contains only the <em>i,j</em> pairs needed to
compute interactions between subsets of atoms for the corresponding
potential.  This means, not all <em>i</em> or <em>j</em> atoms owned by a processor
are included in a particular sub-list.</p></li>
<li><p>Some models use different cutoff lengths for pairwise interactions
between different kinds of particles, which are stored in a single
neighbor list.  One example is a solvated colloidal system with large
colloidal particles where colloid/colloid, colloid/solvent, and
solvent/solvent interaction cutoffs can be dramatically different.
Another is a model of polydisperse finite-size granular particles;
pairs of particles interact only when they are in contact with each
other.  Mixtures with particle size ratios as high as 10-100x may be
used to model realistic systems.  Efficient neighbor list building
algorithms for these kinds of systems are available in LAMMPS.  They
include a method which uses different stencils for different cutoff
lengths and trims the stencil to only include bins that straddle the
cutoff sphere surface.  More recently a method which uses both
multiple stencils and multiple bin sizes was developed; it builds
neighbor lists efficiently for systems with particles of any size
ratio, though other considerations (timestep size, force computations)
may limit the ability to model systems with huge polydispersity.</p></li>
<li><p>For small and sparse systems and as a fallback method, LAMMPS also
supports neighbor list construction without binning by using a full
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(O(N^2)\)</span> loop over all <em>i,j</em> atom pairs in a subdomain when
using the <a class="reference internal" href="neighbor.html"><span class="doc">neighbor nsq</span></a> command.</p></li>
<li><p>Dependent on the “pair” setting of the <a class="reference internal" href="newton.html"><span class="doc">newton</span></a> command,
the “half” neighbor lists may contain <strong>all</strong> pairs of atoms where
atom <em>j</em> is a ghost atom (i.e. when the newton pair setting is <em>off</em>)
For the newton pair <em>on</em> setting the atom <em>j</em> is only added to the
list if its <em>z</em> coordinate is larger, or if equal the <em>y</em> coordinate
is larger, and that is equal, too, the <em>x</em> coordinate is larger.  For
homogeneously dense systems, that will result in picking neighbors from
a same size sector in always the same direction relative to the
“owned” atom, and thus it should lead to similar length neighbor lists
and reduce the chance of a load imbalance.</p></li>
