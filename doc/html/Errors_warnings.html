<p>This is an alphabetic list of the WARNING messages LAMMPS prints out
and the reason why.  If the explanation here is not sufficient, the
documentation for the offending command may help.  Warning messages
also list the source file and line number where the warning was
generated.  For example, a message like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>WARNING: Bond atom missing in box size check (domain.cpp:187)
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>means that line #187 in the file src/domain.cpp generated the error.
Looking in the source code may help you figure out what went wrong.</p>

<dt><em>Bond/angle/dihedral extent &gt; half of periodic box length</em></dt><dd><p>This is a restriction because LAMMPS can be confused about which image
of an atom in the bonded interaction is the correct one to use.
“Extent” in this context means the maximum end-to-end length of the
bond/angle/dihedral.  LAMMPS computes this by taking the maximum bond
length, multiplying by the number of bonds in the interaction (e.g. 3
for a dihedral) and adding a small amount of stretch.</p>

</dd>
<dt><em>Calling write_dump before a full system init.</em></dt><dd><p>The write_dump command is used before the system has been fully
initialized as part of a ‘run’ or ‘minimize’ command. Not all dump
styles and features are fully supported at this point and thus the
command may fail or produce incomplete or incorrect output. Insert
a “run 0” command, if a full system init is required.</p>

<dt><em>Communication cutoff is 0.0. No ghost atoms will be generated. Atoms may get lost</em></dt><dd><p>The communication cutoff defaults to the maximum of what is inferred from
pair and bond styles (will be zero, if none are defined) and what is specified
via <a class="reference internal" href="comm_modify.html"><span class="doc">comm_modify cutoff</span></a> (defaults to 0.0).  If this results
to 0.0, no ghost atoms will be generated and LAMMPS may lose atoms or use
incorrect periodic images of atoms in interaction lists.  To avoid, either use
<a class="reference internal" href="pair_zero.html"><span class="doc">pair style zero</span></a> with a suitable cutoff or use <a class="reference internal" href="comm_modify.html"><span class="doc">comm_modify cutoff</span></a>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>Communication cutoff is shorter than a bond length based estimate. This may lead to errors.</em></dt><dd><p>Since LAMMPS stores topology data with individual atoms, all atoms
comprising a bond, angle, dihedral or improper must be present on any
subdomain that “owns” the atom with the information, either as a
local or a ghost atom. The communication cutoff is what determines up
to what distance from a subdomain boundary ghost atoms are created.
The communication cutoff is by default the largest non-bonded cutoff
plus the neighbor skin distance, but for short or non-bonded cutoffs
and/or long bonds, this may not be sufficient. This warning indicates
that there is an increased risk of a simulation stopping unexpectedly
because of Bond/Angle/Dihedral/Improper atoms missing.  It can be
silenced by manually setting the communication cutoff via
<a class="reference internal" href="comm_modify.html"><span class="doc">comm_modify cutoff</span></a>.  However, since the
heuristic used to determine the estimate is not always accurate, it
is not changed automatically and the warning may be ignored depending
on the specific system being simulated.</p>

to perform this operation correctly.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>Computing temperature of portions of rigid bodies</em></dt><dd><p>The group defined by the temperature compute does not encompass all
the atoms in one or more rigid bodies, so the change in
degrees-of-freedom for the atoms in those partial rigid bodies will
not be accounted for.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>Create_bonds max distance &gt; minimum neighbor cutoff</em></dt><dd><p>This means atom pairs for some atom types may not be in the neighbor
list and thus no bond can be created between them.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>Delete_atoms cutoff &gt; minimum neighbor cutoff</em></dt><dd><p>This means atom pairs for some atom types may not be in the neighbor
list and thus an atom in that pair cannot be deleted.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>Dihedral atoms missing at step %ld</em></dt><dd><p>One or more of 4 atoms needed to compute a particular dihedral are
missing on this processor.  Typically this is because the pairwise

</dd>
<dt><em>Fix bond/create is used multiple times or with fix bond/break - may not work as expected</em></dt><dd><p>When using fix bond/create multiple times or in combination with
fix bond/break, the individual fix instances do not share information
about changes they made at the same time step and thus it may result
in unexpected behavior.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>Fix bond/react: Atom affected by reaction too close to template edge</em></dt><dd><p>This means an atom which changes type or connectivity during the
reaction is too close to an ‘edge’ atom defined in the superimpose
file. This could cause incorrect assignment of bonds, angle, etc.
Generally, this means you must include more atoms in your templates,
such that there are at least two atoms between each atom involved in
the reaction and an edge atom.</p>

restriction.</p>

<dt><em>Fix deposit near setting &lt; possible overlap separation %g</em></dt><dd><p>This test is performed for finite size particles with a diameter, not
for point particles.  The near setting is smaller than the particle
diameter which can lead to overlaps.</p>

<dt><em>Fix evaporate may delete atom with non-zero molecule ID</em></dt><dd><p>This is probably an error, since you should not delete only one atom

is required for systems like the one specified by the user. User input
included one or more of the following: kspace, triclinic, a hybrid
pair style, an eam pair style, or no “single” function for the pair

<dt><em>Fix rattle should come after all other integration fixes</em></dt><dd><p>This fix is designed to work after all other integration fixes change
atom positions.  Thus it should be the last integration fix specified.
If not, it will not satisfy the desired constraints as well as it
otherwise would.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>Fix recenter should come after all other integration fixes</em></dt><dd><p>Other fixes may change the position of the center-of-mass, so
fix recenter should come last.</p>

<dt><em>Group for fix_modify temp != fix group</em></dt><dd><p>The fix_modify command is specifying a temperature computation that
computes a temperature on a different group of atoms than the fix

Compare your input with the documentation.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>Improper atoms missing at step %ld</em></dt><dd><p>One or more of 4 atoms needed to compute a particular improper are
missing on this processor.  Typically this is because the pairwise
cutoff is set too short or the improper has blown apart and an atom is
too far away.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>Improper problem: %d %ld %d %d %d %d</em></dt><dd><p>Conformation of the 4 listed improper atoms is extreme; you may want
to check your simulation geometry.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>Improper style in data file differs from currently defined improper style</em></dt><dd><p>Self-explanatory.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>Impropers are defined but no improper style is set</em></dt><dd><p>The topology contains impropers, but there are no improper forces computed
since there was no improper_style command.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>Inconsistent image flags</em></dt><dd><p>The image flags for a pair on bonded atoms appear to be inconsistent.
Inconsistent means that when the coordinates of the two atoms are
unwrapped using the image flags, the two atoms are far apart.
Specifically they are further apart than half a periodic box length.
Or they are more than a box length apart in a non-periodic dimension.
This is usually due to the initial data file not having correct image
flags for the 2 atoms in a bond that straddles a periodic boundary.
They should be different by 1 in that case.  This is a warning because
inconsistent image flags will not cause problems for dynamics or most
LAMMPS simulations.  However they can cause problems when such atoms
are used with the fix rigid or replicate commands.  Note that if you
have an infinite periodic crystal with bonds then it is impossible to
have fully consistent image flags, since some bonds will cross
periodic boundaries and connect two atoms with the same image
flag.</p>

the communication cutoff requirements for this pair style when run on the GPU.</p>

The special_bonds command handles this consistently by ensuring

triggered by atoms moving the skin distance, this may lead to lost
atoms, if an atom moves all the way across a neighboring processor’s
subdomain before reneighboring is triggered.</p>
