Description

.. versionadded:: 8Feb2023

Angle style *lepton* computes angular interactions between three atoms
with a custom potential function.  The potential function must be
provided as an expression string using "theta" as the angle variable
relative to the reference angle :math:`\theta_0` which is provided as an
angle coefficient.  For example `"200.0*theta^2"` represents a
:doc:`harmonic angle <angle_harmonic>` potential with a force constant
*K* of 200.0 energy units:

.. math::

   U_{angle,i} = K (\theta_i - \theta_0)^2 = K \theta^2 \qquad \theta = \theta_i - \theta_0

The `Lepton library <https://simtk.org/projects/lepton>`_, that the
*lepton* angle style interfaces with, evaluates this expression string
at run time to compute the pairwise energy.  It also creates an
analytical representation of the first derivative of this expression
with respect to "theta" and then uses that to compute the force between
the angle atoms as defined by the topology data.

The following coefficients must be defined for each angle type via the
:doc:`angle_coeff <angle_coeff>` command as in the example above, or in
the data file or restart files read by the :doc:`read_data <read_data>`
or :doc:`read_restart <read_restart>` commands:

* Lepton expression (energy units)
* :math:`\theta_0` (degrees)

The Lepton expression must be either enclosed in quotes or must not
contain any whitespace so that LAMMPS recognizes it as a single keyword.
More on valid Lepton expressions below.  The :math:`\theta_0`
coefficient is the "equilibrium angle".  It is entered in degrees, but
internally converted to radians.  Thus the expression must assume
"theta" is in radians.  The potential energy function in the Lepton
expression is shifted in such a way, that the potential energy is 0 for
a angle :math:`\theta_i == \theta_0`.

This angle style is part of the LEPTON package and only enabled if LAMMPS
was built with this package.  See the :doc:`Build package
