Description
"""""""""""

.. versionadded:: 15Sep2022

Extract per-atom quantities from a pair style and store them in this
fix so they can be accessed by other LAMMPS commands, e.g. by a
:doc:`dump <dump>` command or by another :doc:`fix <fix>`,
:doc:`compute <compute>`, or :doc:`variable <variable>` command.

These are example use cases:

* extract per-atom density from :doc:`pair_style eam <pair_eam>` to a dump file
* extract induced dipoles from :doc:`pair_style amoeba <pair_amoeba>` to a dump file
* extract accuracy metrics from a machine-learned potential to trigger output when
  a condition is met (see the :doc:`dump_modify skip <dump_modify>` command)

The *N* argument determines how often the fix is invoked.

The *pstyle* argument is the name of the pair style.  It can be a
sub-style used in a :doc:`pair_style hybrid <pair_hybrid>` command.  If
there are multiple sub-styles using the same pair style, then *pstyle*
should be specified as "style:N", where *N* is the number of the
instance of the pair style you wish monitor (e.g., the first or second).
For example, *pstyle* could be specified as "pace/extrapolation" or
"amoeba" or "eam:1" or "eam:2".

One or more *name/flag* pairs of arguments follow.  Each *name* is a
per-atom quantity which the pair style must recognize as an extraction
request.  See the doc pages for individual :doc:`pair_styles
<pair_style>` to see what fix pair requests (if any) they support.

The *flag* setting determines whether this fix will also trigger the
pair style to compute the named quantity so it can be extracted.  If the
quantity is always computed by the pair style, no trigger is needed;
specify *flag* = 0.  If the quantity is not always computed
(e.g. because it is expensive to calculate), then specify *flag* = 1.
This will trigger the quantity to be calculated only on timesteps it is
needed.  Again, see the doc pages for individual :doc:`pair_styles
<pair_style>` to determine which fix pair requests (if any) need to be
triggered with a *flag* = 1 setting.

The per-atom data extracted from the pair style is stored by this fix
as either a per-atom vector or array.  If there is only one *name*
argument specified and the pair style computes a single value for each
atom, then this fix stores it as a per-atom vector.  Otherwise a
per-atom array is created, with its data in the order of the *name*
arguments.

For example, :doc:`pair_style amoeba <pair_amoeba>` allows extraction of
two named quantities: "uind" and "uinp", both of which are 3-vectors for
each atom, i.e. dipole moments. In the example below a 6-column per-atom
array will be created.  Columns 1-3 will store the "uind" values;
columns 4-6 will store the "uinp" values.

.. code-block:: LAMMPS

No information about this fix is written to :doc:`binary restart files
<restart>`.  None of the :doc:`fix_modify <fix_modify>` options are
relevant to this fix.

As explained above, this fix produces a per-atom vector or array which
can be accessed by various :doc:`output commands <Howto_output>`.  If
an array is produced, the number of columns is the sum of the number
of per-atom quantities produced by each *name* argument requested from
the pair style.
