Description
"""""""""""

Apply bond and angle constraints to specified bonds and angles in the
simulation by either the SHAKE or RATTLE algorithms.  This typically
enables a longer timestep.  The SHAKE or RATTLE constraint algorithms,
however, can *only* be applied during molecular dynamics runs.

.. versionchanged:: 15Sep2022

These fixes may still be used during minimization.  In that case the
constraints are *approximated* by strong harmonic restraints.

**SHAKE vs RATTLE:**

The SHAKE algorithm was invented for schemes such as standard Verlet
timestepping, where only the coordinates are integrated and the
velocities are approximated as finite differences to the trajectories
(:ref:`Ryckaert et al. (1977) <Ryckaert>`).  If the velocities are
integrated explicitly, as with velocity Verlet which is what LAMMPS
uses as an integration method, a second set of constraining forces is
required in order to eliminate velocity components along the bonds
(:ref:`Andersen (1983) <Andersen3>`).

In order to formulate individual constraints for SHAKE and RATTLE,
focus on a single molecule whose bonds are constrained.  Let Ri and Vi
be the position and velocity of atom *i* at time *n*, for
*i* =1,...,\ *N*, where *N* is the number of sites of our reference
molecule. The distance vector between sites *i* and *j* is given by

.. math::

   \mathbf r^{n+1}_{ij} = \mathbf r^n_j - \mathbf r^n_i

The constraints can then be formulated as

.. math::

   \mathbf r^{n+1}_{ij} \cdot \mathbf r^{n+1}_{ij} &= d^2_{ij} \quad \text{and} \\
   \mathbf v^{n+1}_{ij} \cdot \mathbf r^{n+1}_{ij} &= 0

The SHAKE algorithm satisfies the first condition, i.e. the sites at
time *n+1* will have the desired separations Dij immediately after the
coordinates are integrated.  If we also enforce the second condition,
the velocity components along the bonds will vanish.  RATTLE satisfies
both conditions.  As implemented in LAMMPS, *fix rattle* uses fix shake
for satisfying the coordinate constraints. Therefore the settings and
optional keywords are the same for both fixes, and all the information
below about SHAKE is also relevant for RATTLE.

**SHAKE:**

Each timestep the specified bonds and angles are reset to their
equilibrium lengths and angular values via the SHAKE algorithm
(:ref:`Ryckaert et al. (1977) <Ryckaert>`).  This is done by applying an
additional constraint force so that the new positions preserve the
desired atom separations.  The equations for the additional force are
solved via an iterative method that typically converges to an accurate
solution in a few iterations.  The desired tolerance (e.g. 1.0e-4 = 1
part in 10000) and maximum # of iterations are specified as arguments.
Setting the N argument will print statistics to the screen and log
file about regarding the lengths of bonds and angles that are being
constrained.  Small delta values mean SHAKE is doing a good job.

In LAMMPS, only small clusters of atoms can be constrained.  This is
so the constraint calculation for a cluster can be performed by a
single processor, to enable good parallel performance.  A cluster is
defined as a central atom connected to others in the cluster by
constrained bonds.  LAMMPS allows for the following kinds of clusters
to be constrained: one central atom bonded to 1 or 2 or 3 atoms, or
one central atom bonded to 2 others and the angle between the 3 atoms
also constrained.  This means water molecules or CH2 or CH3 groups may
be constrained, but not all the C-C backbone bonds of a long polymer
chain.

The *b* constraint lists bond types that will be constrained.  The *t*
constraint lists atom types.  All bonds connected to an atom of the
specified type will be constrained.  The *m* constraint lists atom
masses.  All bonds connected to atoms of the specified masses will be
constrained (within a fudge factor of MASSDELTA specified in
fix_shake.cpp).  The *a* constraint lists angle types.  If both bonds
in the angle are constrained then the angle will also be constrained
if its type is in the list.

For all constraints, a particular bond is only constrained if both
atoms in the bond are in the group specified with the SHAKE fix.

The degrees-of-freedom removed by SHAKE bonds and angles are accounted
for in temperature and pressure computations.  Similarly, the SHAKE
contribution to the pressure of the system (virial) is also accounted
for.

.. note::

   This command works by using the current forces on atoms to calculate
   an additional constraint force which when added will leave the atoms
   in positions that satisfy the SHAKE constraints (e.g. bond length)
   after the next time integration step.  If you define fixes
   (e.g. :doc:`fix efield <fix_efield>`) that add additional force to
   the atoms after *fix shake* operates, then this fix will not take them
   into account and the time integration will typically not satisfy the
   SHAKE constraints.  The solution for this is to make sure that fix
   shake is defined in your input script after any other fixes which add
   or change forces (to atoms that *fix shake* operates on).

----------

The *mol* keyword should be used when other commands, such as :doc:`fix
deposit <fix_deposit>` or :doc:`fix pour <fix_pour>`, add molecules
on-the-fly during a simulation, and you wish to constrain the new
molecules via SHAKE.  You specify a *template-ID* previously defined
using the :doc:`molecule <molecule>` command, which reads a file that
defines the molecule.  You must use the same *template-ID* that the
command adding molecules uses.  The coordinates, atom types, special
bond restrictions, and SHAKE info can be specified in the molecule file.
See the :doc:`molecule <molecule>` command for details.  The only
settings required to be in this file (by this command) are the SHAKE
info of atoms in the molecule.

The *kbond* keyword sets the restraint force constant when *fix shake*
or fix rattle are used during minimization.  In that case the constraint
algorithms are *not* applied and restraint forces are used instead to
maintain the geometries similar to the constraints.  How well the
geometries are maintained and how quickly a minimization converges,
depends largely on the force constant *kbond*: larger values will reduce
the deviation from the desired geometry, but can also lead to slower
convergence of the minimization or lead to instabilities depending on
the minimization algorithm requiring to reduce the value of
:doc:`timestep <timestep>`.  Even though the restraints will not
preserve the bond lengths and angles as closely as the constraints
during the MD, they are generally close enough so that the constraints
will be fulfilled to the desired accuracy within a few MD steps
following the minimization. The default value for *kbond* depends on the
:doc:`units <units>` setting and is 1.0e6*k_B.

**RATTLE:**

The velocity constraints lead to a linear system of equations which
can be solved analytically.  The implementation of the algorithm in
LAMMPS closely follows (:ref:`Andersen (1983) <Andersen3>`).

.. note::

   The *fix rattle* command modifies forces and velocities and thus
   should be defined after all other integration fixes in your input
   script.  If you define other fixes that modify velocities or forces
   after *fix rattle* operates, then *fix rattle* will not take them into
   account and the overall time integration will typically not satisfy
   the RATTLE constraints.  You can check whether the constraints work
   correctly by setting the value of RATTLE_DEBUG in src/fix_rattle.cpp
   to 1 and recompiling LAMMPS.

"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

No information about these fixes is written to :doc:`binary restart
files <restart>`.

Both fix *shake* and fix *rattle* behave differently during a minimization
in comparison to a molecular dynamics run:

- When used during a minimization, the SHAKE or RATTLE constraint
  algorithms themselves are **not** applied.  Instead the constraints
  are replaced by harmonic restraint forces.  The energy and virial
  contributions due to the restraint forces are tallied into global and
  per-atom accumulators. The total restraint energy is also accessible
  as a global scalar property of the fix.

- During molecular dynamics runs, however, the fixes do apply the
  requested SHAKE or RATTLE constraint algorithms.

  The :doc:`fix_modify <fix_modify>` *virial* option is supported by
  these fixes to add the contribution due to the added constraint forces
  on atoms to both the global pressure and per-atom stress of the system
  via the :doc:`compute pressure <compute_pressure>` and :doc:`compute
  stress/atom <compute_stress_atom>` commands.  The former can be
  accessed by :doc:`thermodynamic output <thermo_style>`.

  The  default  setting  for  this  fix  is  :doc:`fix_modify  virial  yes
  <fix_modify>`.  No global  or per-atom  quantities are  stored by  these
  fixes for access by various :doc:`output commands <Howto_output>` during
  an  MD  run.   No  parameter  of  these  fixes  can  be  used  with  the
  *start/stop* keywords of the :doc:`run <run>` command.


Restrictions
""""""""""""

These fixes are part of the RIGID package.  They are only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the :doc:`Build package
<Build_package>` page for more info.

For computational efficiency, there can only be one shake or rattle
fix defined in a simulation.

If you use a tolerance that is too large or a max-iteration count that
is too small, the constraints will not be enforced very strongly,
which can lead to poor energy conservation.  You can test for this in
your system by running a constant NVE simulation with a particular set
of SHAKE parameters and monitoring the energy versus time.

SHAKE or RATTLE should not be used to constrain an angle at 180 degrees
(e.g. a linear CO2 molecule).  This causes a divergence when solving the
constraint equations numerically.  You can use :doc:`fix rigid or fix
rigid/small <fix_rigid>` instead to make a linear molecule rigid.

When used during minimization choosing a too large value of the *kbond*
can make minimization very inefficient and also cause stability problems
with some minimization algorithms.  Sometimes those can be avoided by
reducing the :doc:`timestep <timestep>`.
