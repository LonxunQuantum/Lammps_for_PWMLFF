This directory contains Fortran code that acts as an interface to LAMMPS as a
library and allows the LAMMPS library interface to be invoked from Fortran
code.  It requires a Fortran compiler that supports the Fortran 2003 standard
sufficiently well. For example GNU Fortran 9.x or later is currently required.

This interface is based on and supersedes the previous Fortran interfaces
in the examples/COUPLE/fortran* folders, but it is fully supported by the
LAMMPS developers and included in the documentation and unit testing.

Details on this Fortran interface and how to build programs using it
are in the manual in the doc/html/Fortran.html file.
