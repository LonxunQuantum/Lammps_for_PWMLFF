Each of the directories shows how to use LAMMPS in tandem with a
specific quantum code

LATTE = semi-empirical tight-binding code from LANL

To be added later (as of Aug 2022):

Quantum Espresso (QE) = DFT code for materials modeling

DFT-FE = real-space DFT code from U Michigan
  https://github.com/dftfeDevelopers/dftfe

INQ = DFT code from LLNL
  https://github.com/LLNL/inq

NWChem = computational chemistry code from PNNL
  focus here is on DFT portion of NWChem
