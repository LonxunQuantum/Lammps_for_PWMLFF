The :f:mod:`LIBLAMMPS` Fortran Module
*************************************

The :f:mod:`LIBLAMMPS` module provides an interface to call LAMMPS from
Fortran.  It is based on the LAMMPS C library interface and requires a
fully Fortran 2003-compatible compiler to be compiled.  It is designed
to be self-contained and not require any support functions written in C,
C++, or Fortran other than those in the C library interface and the
LAMMPS Fortran module itself.

While C libraries have a defined binary interface (ABI) and can thus be
used from multiple compiler versions from different vendors as long as
they are compatible with the hosting operating system, the same is not
true for Fortran programs.  Thus, the LAMMPS Fortran module needs to be
compiled alongside the code using it from the source code in
``fortran/lammps.f90`` *and* with the same compiler used to build the
rest of the Fortran code that interfaces to LAMMPS.  When linking, you
also need to :doc:`link to the LAMMPS library <Build_link>`.  A typical
command line for a simple program using the Fortran interface would be:

.. code-block:: bash

   mpifort -o testlib.x lammps.f90 testlib.f90 -L. -llammps

Please note that the MPI compiler wrapper is only required when the
calling the library *from* an MPI-parallelized program.  Otherwise,
using the plain Fortran compiler (gfortran, ifort, flang, etc.) will
suffice, since there are no direct references to MPI library features,
definitions and subroutine calls; MPI communicators are referred to by
their integer index representation as required by the Fortran MPI
interface.  It may be necessary to link to additional libraries,
depending on how LAMMPS was configured and whether the LAMMPS library
:doc:`was compiled as a static or dynamic library <Build_link>`.

If the LAMMPS library itself has been compiled with MPI support, the
resulting executable will be able to run LAMMPS in parallel with
``mpirun``, ``mpiexec``, or equivalent.  This may be either on the
"world" communicator or a sub-communicator created by the calling
Fortran code.  If, on the other hand, the LAMMPS library has been
compiled **without** MPI support, each LAMMPS instance will run
independently using just one processor.

Please also note that the order of the source files matters: the
``lammps.f90`` file needs to be compiled first, since it provides the
:f:mod:`LIBLAMMPS` module that would need to be imported by the calling
Fortran code in order to uses the Fortran interface.
A working example can be found together with equivalent examples in C and
C++ in the ``examples/COUPLE/simple`` folder of the LAMMPS distribution.

.. admonition:: Fortran compiler compatibility
   :class: note

   A fully Fortran 2003 compatible Fortran compiler is required.
   This means that currently only GNU Fortran 9 and later are
   compatible and thus the default compilers of Red Hat or CentOS 7
   and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and not compatible.  Either newer compilers
   need to be installed or the Linux updated.

.. versionchanged:: 8Feb2023

.. note::

   A contributed Fortran interface is available in the
   ``examples/COUPLE/fortran2`` folder.  However, since the completion
   of the :f:mod:`LIBLAMMPS` module, this interface is now deprecated,
   no longer actively maintained and will likely be removed in the
   future.  Please see the ``README`` file in that folder for more
   information about it and how to contact its author and maintainer.

Creating or deleting a LAMMPS object
************************************

With the Fortran interface, the creation of a :cpp:class:`LAMMPS
<LAMMPS_NS::LAMMPS>` instance is included in the constructor for
creating the :f:func:`lammps` derived type.  To import the definition of
that type and its type-bound procedures, you need to add a ``USE LIBLAMMPS``
statement.  Internally, it will call either
:cpp:func:`lammps_open_fortran` or :cpp:func:`lammps_open_no_mpi` from
the C library API to create the class instance.  All arguments are
optional and :cpp:func:`lammps_mpi_init` will be called automatically
if it is needed.  Similarly, a possible call to
:cpp:func:`lammps_mpi_finalize` is integrated into the :f:func:`close`
function and triggered with the optional logical argument set to
``.TRUE.``. Here is a simple example:

.. code-block:: fortran

   PROGRAM testlib
     USE LIBLAMMPS                 ! include the LAMMPS library interface
     IMPLICIT NONE
     TYPE(lammps) :: lmp           ! derived type to hold LAMMPS instance
     CHARACTER(LEN=12), PARAMETER :: args(3) = &
         [ CHARACTER(LEN=12) :: 'liblammps', '-log', 'none' ]

     ! create a LAMMPS instance (and initialize MPI)
     lmp = lammps(args)
     ! get and print numerical version code
     PRINT*, 'LAMMPS Version: ', lmp%version()
     ! delete LAMMPS instance (and shutdown MPI)
     CALL lmp%close(.TRUE.)
   END PROGRAM testlib

It is also possible to pass command line flags from Fortran to C/C++ and
thus make the resulting executable behave similarly to the standalone
executable (it will ignore the `-in/-i` flag, though).  This allows
using the command line to configure accelerator and suffix settings,
configure screen and logfile output, or to set index style variables
from the command line and more.  Here is a correspondingly adapted
version of the previous example:

.. code-block:: fortran

   PROGRAM testlib2
     USE LIBLAMMPS                 ! include the LAMMPS library interface
     IMPLICIT NONE
     TYPE(lammps) :: lmp           ! derived type to hold LAMMPS instance
     CHARACTER(LEN=128), ALLOCATABLE :: command_args(:)
     INTEGER :: i, argc

     ! copy command line flags to `command_args()`
     argc = COMMAND_ARGUMENT_COUNT()
     ALLOCATE(command_args(0:argc))
     DO i=0, argc
       CALL GET_COMMAND_ARGUMENT(i, command_args(i))
     END DO

     ! create a LAMMPS instance (and initialize MPI)
     lmp = lammps(command_args)
     ! get and print numerical version code
     PRINT*, 'Program name:   ', command_args(0)
     PRINT*, 'LAMMPS Version: ', lmp%version()
     ! delete LAMMPS instance (and shuts down MPI)
     CALL lmp%close(.TRUE.)
     DEALLOCATE(command_args)
   END PROGRAM testlib2

--------------------

Executing LAMMPS commands
*************************

Once a LAMMPS instance is created, it is possible to "drive" the LAMMPS
simulation by telling LAMMPS to read commands from a file or to pass
individual or multiple commands from strings or lists of strings.  This
is done similarly to how it is implemented in the :doc:`C library
interface <Library_execute>`. Before handing off the calls to the
C library interface, the corresponding Fortran versions of the calls
(:f:func:`file`, :f:func:`command`, :f:func:`commands_list`, and
:f:func:`commands_string`) have to make copies of the strings passed as
arguments so that they can be modified to be compatible with the
requirements of strings in C without affecting the original strings.
Those copies are automatically deleted after the functions return.
Below is a small demonstration of the uses of the different functions.

.. code-block:: fortran

   PROGRAM testcmd
     USE LIBLAMMPS
     TYPE(lammps) :: lmp
     CHARACTER(LEN=512) :: cmds
     CHARACTER(LEN=40), ALLOCATABLE :: cmdlist(:)
     CHARACTER(LEN=10) :: trimmed
     INTEGER :: i

     lmp = lammps()
     CALL lmp%file('in.melt')
     CALL lmp%command('variable zpos index 1.0')
     ! define 10 groups of 10 atoms each
     ALLOCATE(cmdlist(10))
     DO i=1, 10
       WRITE(trimmed,'(I10)') 10*i
       WRITE(cmdlist(i),'(A,I1,A,I10,A,A)')       &
           'group g', i-1, ' id ', 10*(i-1)+1, ':', ADJUSTL(trimmed)
     END DO
     CALL lmp%commands_list(cmdlist)
     ! run multiple commands from multi-line string
     cmds = 'clear' // NEW_LINE('A') //                       &
         'region  box block 0 2 0 2 0 2' // NEW_LINE('A') //  &
         'create_box 1 box' // NEW_LINE('A') //               &
         'create_atoms 1 single 1.0 1.0 ${zpos}'
     CALL lmp%commands_string(cmds)
     CALL lmp%close(.TRUE.)
   END PROGRAM testcmd

Accessing system properties
***************************

The C library interface allows the :doc:`extraction of different kinds
of information <Library_properties>` about the active simulation
instance and also---in some cases---to apply modifications to it, and the
Fortran interface provides access to the same data using Fortran-style,
C-interoperable data types.  In some cases, the Fortran library interface makes
pointers to internal LAMMPS data structures accessible; when accessing them
through the library interfaces, special care is needed to avoid data corruption
and crashes.  Please see the documentation of the individual type-bound
procedures for details.

Below is an example demonstrating some of the possible uses.

.. code-block:: fortran

  PROGRAM testprop
    USE LIBLAMMPS
    USE, INTRINSIC :: ISO_C_BINDING, ONLY : c_double, c_int64_t
    USE, INTRINSIC :: ISO_FORTRAN_ENV, ONLY : OUTPUT_UNIT
    TYPE(lammps) :: lmp
    INTEGER(KIND=c_int64_t), POINTER :: natoms
    REAL(KIND=c_double), POINTER :: dt
    INTEGER(KIND=c_int64_t), POINTER :: ntimestep
    REAL(KIND=c_double) :: pe, ke

    lmp = lammps()
    CALL lmp%file('in.sysinit')
    natoms = lmp%extract_global('natoms')
    WRITE(OUTPUT_UNIT,'(A,I0,A)') 'Running a simulation with ', natoms, ' atoms'
    WRITE(OUTPUT_UNIT,'(I0,A,I0,A,I0,A)') lmp%extract_setting('nlocal'), &
        ' local and ', lmp%extract_setting('nghost'), ' ghost atoms. ', &
        lmp%extract_setting('ntypes'), ' atom types'

    CALL lmp%command('run 2 post no')
    dt = lmp%extract_global('dt')
    ntimestep = lmp%extract_global('ntimestep')
    WRITE(OUTPUT_UNIT,'(A,I0,A,F4.1,A)') 'At step: ', ntimestep, &
        '  Changing timestep from', dt, ' to 0.5'
    dt = 0.5_c_double
    CALL lmp%command('run 2 post no')

    WRITE(OUTPUT_UNIT,'(A,I0)') 'At step: ', ntimestep
    pe = lmp%get_thermo('pe')
    ke = lmp%get_thermo('ke')
    PRINT*, 'PE = ', pe
    PRINT*, 'KE = ', ke

    CALL lmp%close(.TRUE.)
  END PROGRAM testprop

.. f:function:: lammps([args][,comm])

   This is the constructor for the Fortran class and will forward
   the arguments to a call to either :cpp:func:`lammps_open_fortran`
   or :cpp:func:`lammps_open_no_mpi`. If the LAMMPS library has been
   compiled with MPI support, it will also initialize MPI, if it has
   not already been initialized before.

   The *args* argument with the list of command line parameters is
   optional and so it the *comm* argument with the MPI communicator.
   If *comm* is not provided, ``MPI_COMM_WORLD`` is assumed. For
   more details please see the documentation of :cpp:func:`lammps_open`.

   :o args: arguments as list of strings
   :otype args: character(len=\*),dimension(:),optional

   :otype comm: integer,optional
   :to: :cpp:func:`lammps_open_fortran`
   :to: :cpp:func:`lammps_open_no_mpi`
   :r lammps: an instance of the :f:type:`lammps` derived type

   .. note::

      The :f:mod:`MPI_F08` module, which defines Fortran 2008 bindings for MPI,
      is not directly supported by this interface due to the complexities of
      supporting both the :f:mod:`MPI_F08` and :f:mod:`MPI` modules at the same
      time. However, you should be able to use the ``MPI_VAL`` member of the
      ``MPI_comm`` derived type to access the integer value of the
      communicator, such as in

      .. code-block:: fortran

         PROGRAM testmpi
           USE LIBLAMMPS
           USE MPI_F08
           TYPE(lammps) :: lmp
           lmp = lammps(comm=MPI_COMM_SELF%MPI_VAL)
         END PROGRAM testmpi

.. f:type:: lammps_style

   This derived type is there to provide a convenient interface for the style
   constants used with :f:func:`extract_compute`, :f:func:`extract_fix`, and
   :f:func:`extract_variable`. Assuming your LAMMPS instance is called ``lmp``,
   these constants will be ``lmp%style%global``, ``lmp%style%atom``,
   and ``lmp%style%local``. These values are identical to the values described
   in :cpp:enum:`_LMP_STYLE_CONST` for the C library interface.

   :f integer(c_int) global: used to request global data
   :f integer(c_int) atom:   used to request per-atom data
   :f integer(c_int) local:  used to request local data

.. f:type:: lammps_type

   This derived type is there to provide a convenient interface for the type
   constants used with :f:func:`extract_compute`, :f:func:`extract_fix`, and
   :f:func:`extract_variable`. Assuming your LAMMPS instance is called ``lmp``,
   these constants will be ``lmp%type%scalar``, ``lmp%type%vector``, and
   ``lmp%type%array``. These values are identical to the values described
   in :cpp:enum:`_LMP_TYPE_CONST` for the C library interface.

   :f integer(c_int) scalar: used to request scalars
   :f integer(c_int) vector: used to request vectors
   :f integer(c_int) array:  used to request arrays (matrices)

Procedures Bound to the :f:type:`lammps` Derived Type
=====================================================

.. f:subroutine:: close([finalize])

   This method will close down the LAMMPS instance through calling
   :cpp:func:`lammps_close`.  If the *finalize* argument is present and
   has a value of ``.TRUE.``, then this subroutine also calls
   :cpp:func:`lammps_kokkos_finalize` and
   :cpp:func:`lammps_mpi_finalize`.

   :o finalize: shut down the MPI environment of the LAMMPS
    library if ``.TRUE.``.
   :otype finalize: logical,optional
   :to: :cpp:func:`lammps_close`
   :to: :cpp:func:`lammps_mpi_finalize`
   :to: :cpp:func:`lammps_kokkos_finalize`

--------

.. f:subroutine:: error(error_type, error_text)

   This method is a wrapper around the :cpp:func:`lammps_error` function and
   will dispatch an error through the LAMMPS Error class.

   .. versionadded:: 3Nov2022

   :p error_type: constant to select which Error class function to call
   :ptype error_type: integer(c_int)
   :p character(len=\*) error_text: error message
   :to: :cpp:func:`lammps_error`

--------

.. f:subroutine:: file(filename)

   This method will call :cpp:func:`lammps_file` to have LAMMPS read
   and process commands from a file.

   :p character(len=\*) filename: name of file with LAMMPS commands
   :to: :cpp:func:`lammps_file`

--------

.. f:subroutine:: command(cmd)

   This method will call :cpp:func:`lammps_command` to have LAMMPS
   execute a single command.

   :p character(len=\*) cmd: single LAMMPS command
   :to: :cpp:func:`lammps_command`

--------

.. f:subroutine:: commands_list(cmds)

   This method will call :cpp:func:`lammps_commands_list` to have LAMMPS
   execute a list of input lines.

   :p character(len=\*) cmd [dimension(:)]: list of LAMMPS input lines
   :to: :cpp:func:`lammps_commands_list`

--------

.. f:subroutine:: commands_string(str)

   This method will call :cpp:func:`lammps_commands_string` to have LAMMPS
   execute a block of commands from a string.

   :p character(len=\*) str: LAMMPS input in string
   :to: :cpp:func:`lammps_commands_string`

--------

.. f:function:: get_natoms()

   This function will call :cpp:func:`lammps_get_natoms` and return the number
   of atoms in the system.

   :to: :cpp:func:`lammps_get_natoms`
   :r real(c_double) natoms: number of atoms

   .. note::

      If you would prefer to get the number of atoms in its native format
      (i.e., as a 32- or 64-bit integer, depending on how LAMMPS was compiled),
      this can be extracted with :f:func:`extract_global`.

.. f:function:: get_thermo(name)

   This function will call :cpp:func:`lammps_get_thermo` and return the value
   of the corresponding thermodynamic keyword.

.. f:subroutine:: extract_box([boxlo][, boxhi][, xy][, yz][, xz][, pflags][, boxflag])

   This subroutine will call :cpp:func:`lammps_extract_box`. All
   parameters are optional, though obviously at least one should be
   present. The parameters *pflags* and *boxflag* are stored in LAMMPS
   as integers, but should be declared as ``LOGICAL`` variables when
   calling from Fortran.

   .. versionadded:: 3Nov2022

   :o real(c_double) boxlo [dimension(3),optional]: vector in which to store
    lower-bounds of simulation box
   :o real(c_double) boxhi [dimension(3),optional]: vector in which to store
    upper-bounds of simulation box
   :o real(c_double) xy [optional]: variable in which to store *xy* tilt factor
   :o real(c_double) yz [optional]: variable in which to store *yz* tilt factor
   :o real(c_double) xz [optional]: variable in which to store *xz* tilt factor
   :o pflags: vector in which to store
    periodicity flags (``.TRUE.`` means periodic in that dimension)
   :otype pflags: logical,dimension(3),optional
   :o boxflag: variable in which to store boolean denoting
    whether the box will change during a simulation
    (``.TRUE.`` means box will change)
   :otype boxflag: logical,optional
   :to: :cpp:func:`lammps_extract_box`

.. note::

   Note that a frequent use case of this function is to extract only one or
   more of the options rather than all seven. For example, assuming "lmp"
   represents a properly-initialized LAMMPS instance, the following code will
   extract the periodic box settings into the variable "periodic":

   .. code-block:: fortran

      ! code to start up
      LOGICAL :: periodic(3)
      ! code to initialize LAMMPS / run things / etc.
      CALL lmp%extract_box(pflags = periodic)

   This subroutine will call :cpp:func:`lammps_reset_box`. All parameters
   are required.

   .. versionadded:: 3Nov2022

   :p real(c_double) boxlo [dimension(3)]: vector of three doubles containing
    the lower box boundary

   :p real(c_double) xy: *x--y* tilt factor

.. f:function:: get_mpi_comm()

   This function returns a Fortran representation of the LAMMPS "world"
   communicator.

   .. versionadded:: 3Nov2022

   :to: :cpp:func:`lammps_get_mpi_comm`
   :r comm: Fortran integer equivalent to the MPI communicator LAMMPS is
    using
   :rtype comm: integer

   .. note::

       The C library interface currently returns type ``int`` instead of
       type ``MPI_Fint``, which is the C type corresponding to Fortran
       ``INTEGER`` types of the default kind.  On most compilers, these
       are the same anyway, but this interface exchanges values this way
       to avoid warning messages.

   .. note::

      The :f:mod:`MPI_F08` module, which defines Fortran 2008 bindings for MPI,
      is not directly supported by this function.  However, you should be
      able to convert between the two using the `MPI_VAL` member of the
      communicator.  For example,

      .. code-block:: fortran

         USE MPI_F08
         USE LIBLAMMPS
         TYPE(lammps) :: lmp
         TYPE(MPI_Comm) :: comm
         ! ... [commands to set up LAMMPS/etc.]
         comm%MPI_VAL = lmp%get_mpi_comm()

      should assign an :f:mod:`MPI_F08` communicator properly.

.. f:function:: extract_setting(keyword)

   Query LAMMPS about global settings. See the documentation for the
   :cpp:func:`lammps_extract_setting` function from the C library.

   .. versionadded:: 3Nov2022

   :p character(len=\*) keyword: string containing the name of the thermo keyword
   :to: :cpp:func:`lammps_extract_setting`
   :r integer(c_int) setting: value of the queried setting or :math:`-1` if
    unknown

--------

.. f:function:: extract_global(name)

   This function calls :cpp:func:`lammps_extract_global` and returns
   either a string or a pointer to internal global LAMMPS data,
   depending on the data requested through *name*.

   .. versionadded:: 3Nov2022

   Note that this function actually does not return a value, but rather
   associates the pointer on the left side of the assignment to point to
   internal LAMMPS data (with the exception of string data, which are
   copied and returned as ordinary Fortran strings). Pointers must be of
   the correct data type to point to said data (typically
   ``INTEGER(c_int)``, ``INTEGER(c_int64_t)``, or ``REAL(c_double)``)
   and have compatible kind and rank.  The pointer being associated with
   LAMMPS data is type-, kind-, and rank-checked at run-time via an
   overloaded assignment operator.  The pointers returned by this
   function are generally persistent; therefore it is not necessary to
   call the function again unless a :doc:`clear` command has been
   issued, which wipes out and recreates the contents of the
   :cpp:class:`LAMMPS <LAMMPS_NS::LAMMPS>` class.

   For example,

   .. code-block:: fortran

      PROGRAM demo
        USE, INTRINSIC :: ISO_C_BINDING, ONLY : c_int64_t, c_int, c_double
        USE LIBLAMMPS
        TYPE(lammps) :: lmp
        INTEGER(c_int), POINTER :: nlocal => NULL()
        INTEGER(c_int64_t), POINTER :: ntimestep => NULL()
        REAL(c_double), POINTER :: dt => NULL()
        CHARACTER(LEN=10) :: units
        lmp = lammps()
        ! other commands
        nlocal = lmp%extract_global('nlocal')
        ntimestep = lmp%extract_global('ntimestep')
        dt = lmp%extract_global('dt')
        units = lmp%extract_global('units')
        ! more commands
        lmp.close(.TRUE.)
      END PROGRAM demo

   would extract the number of atoms on this processor, the current time step,
   the size of the current time step, and the units being used into the
   variables *nlocal*, *ntimestep*, *dt*, and *units*, respectively.

   .. note::

      If :f:func:`extract_global` returns a string, the string must have length
      greater than or equal to the length of the string (not including the
      terminal ``NULL`` character) that LAMMPS returns. If the variable's
      length is too short, the string will be truncated. As usual in Fortran,
      strings are padded with spaces at the end. If you use an allocatable
      string, the string **must be allocated** prior to calling this function,
      but you can automatically reallocate it to the correct length after the
      function returns, viz.,

      .. code-block :: fortran

         PROGRAM test
           USE LIBLAMMPS
           TYPE(lammps) :: lmp
           CHARACTER(LEN=:), ALLOCATABLE :: str
           lmp = lammps()
           CALL lmp%command('units metal')
           ALLOCATE(CHARACTER(LEN=80) :: str)
           str = lmp%extract_global('units')
           str = TRIM(str) ! re-allocates to length len_trim(str) here
           PRINT*, LEN(str), LEN_TRIM(str)
         END PROGRAM test

      will print the number 5 (the length of the word "metal") twice.

   :p character(len=\*) name: string with the name of the property to extract
   :to: :cpp:func:`lammps_extract_global`
   :r pointer [polymorphic]: pointer to LAMMPS data. The left-hand side of the
    assignment should be either a string (if expecting string data) or a
    C-compatible pointer (e.g., ``INTEGER(c_int), POINTER :: nlocal``) to the
    extracted property. If expecting vector data, the pointer should have
    dimension ":".

   .. warning::

       Modifying the data in the location pointed to by the returned pointer
       may lead to inconsistent internal data and thus may cause failures,
       crashes, or bogus simulations.  In general, it is much better
       to use a LAMMPS input command that sets or changes these parameters.
       Using an input command will take care of all side effects and necessary
       updates of settings derived from such settings.

--------

.. f:function:: extract_atom(name)

   This function calls :cpp:func:`lammps_extract_atom` and returns a pointer to
   LAMMPS data tied to the :cpp:class:`Atom` class, depending on the data
   requested through *name*.

   .. versionadded:: 3Nov2022

   Note that this function actually does not return a pointer, but rather
   associates the pointer on the left side of the assignment to point
   to internal LAMMPS data. Pointers must be of the correct type, kind, and
   rank (e.g., ``INTEGER(c_int), DIMENSION(:)`` for "type", "mask", or "id";
   ``INTEGER(c_int64_t), DIMENSION(:)`` for "id" if LAMMPS was compiled
   with the ``-DLAMMPS_BIGBIG`` flag; ``REAL(c_double), DIMENSION(:,:)`` for
   "x", "v", or "f"; and so forth). The pointer being associated with LAMMPS
   data is type-, kind-, and rank-checked at run-time.

   :p character(len=\*) name: string with the name of the property to extract
   :to: :cpp:func:`lammps_extract_atom`
   :r pointer: pointer to LAMMPS data. The left-hand side of the
    assignment should be a C-interoperable pointer of appropriate kind and rank
    (e.g., ``INTEGER(c_int), POINTER :: mask(:)``) to the extracted
    property. If expecting vector data, the pointer should have dimension ":";
    if expecting matrix data, the pointer should have dimension ":,:".
   :rtype pointer: polymorphic

   .. warning::

      Pointers returned by this function are generally not persistent, as
      per-atom data may be redistributed, reallocated, and reordered at every
      re-neighboring operation. It is advisable to re-bind pointers using
      :f:func:`extract_atom` between runs.

   .. admonition:: Array index order

      Two-dimensional arrays returned from :f:func:`extract_atom` will be
      **transposed** from equivalent arrays in C, and they will be indexed
      from 1 instead of 0. For example, in C,

      .. code-block:: c

         void *lmp;
         double **x;
         /* more code to setup, etc. */
         x = lammps_extract_atom(lmp, "x");
         printf("%f\n", x[5][1]);

      will print the *y*-coordinate of the sixth atom on this processor.
      Conversely,

      .. code-block:: fortran

         TYPE(lammps) :: lmp
         REAL(c_double), DIMENSION(:,:), POINTER :: x => NULL()
         ! more code to setup, etc.
         x = lmp%extract_atom("x")
         PRINT '(f0.6)', x(2,6)

      will print the *y*-coordinate of the sixth atom on this processor
      (note the transposition of the two indices). This is not a choice, but
      rather a consequence of the different conventions adopted by the Fortran
      and C standards decades ago: in C, the block of data

      .. parsed-literal::

         1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16

      interpreted as a :math:`4\times4` matrix would be

      .. math::

         \begin{bmatrix}
           1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\
           5 & 6 & 7 & 8 \\
           9 & 10 & 11 & 12 \\
           13 & 14 & 15 & 16
         \end{bmatrix},

      that is, in row-major order. In Fortran, the same block of data is
      interpreted in column-major order, namely,

      .. math::

         \begin{bmatrix}
           1 & 5 & 9  & 13 \\
           2 & 6 & 10 & 14 \\
           3 & 7 & 11 & 15 \\
           4 & 8 & 12 & 16
         \end{bmatrix}.

      This difference in interpretation of the same block of data by the two
      languages means, in effect, that matrices from C or C++ will be
      transposed when interpreted in Fortran.

   .. note::

      If you would like the indices to start at 0 instead of 1 (which follows
      typical notation in C and C++, but not Fortran), you can create another
      pointer and associate it thus:

      .. code-block:: fortran

         REAL(c_double), DIMENSION(:,:), POINTER :: x, x0
         x = lmp%extract_atom("x")
         x0(0:,0:) => x

      The above would cause the dimensions of *x* to be (1:3, 1:nmax)
      and those of *x0* to be (0:2, 0:nmax\ :math:`-`\ 1).

--------

.. f:function:: extract_compute(id, style, type)

   This function calls :cpp:func:`lammps_extract_compute` and returns a pointer
   to LAMMPS data tied to the :cpp:class:`Compute` class, specifically data
   provided by the compute identified by *id*. Computes may provide global,
   per-atom, or local data, and those data may be a scalar, a vector, or an
   array. Since computes may provide multiple kinds of data, the user is
   required to specify which set of data is to be returned through the
   *style* and *type* variables.

   .. versionadded:: 3Nov2022

   Note that this function actually does not return a value, but rather
   associates the pointer on the left side of the assignment to point to
   internal LAMMPS data. Pointers must be of the correct data type to point to
   said data (i.e., ``REAL(c_double)``) and have compatible rank.  The pointer
   being associated with LAMMPS data is type-, kind-, and rank-checked at
   run-time via an overloaded assignment operator.

   For example,

   .. code-block:: fortran

      TYPE(lammps) :: lmp
      REAL(c_double), DIMENSION(:), POINTER :: COM
      ! code to setup, create atoms, etc.
      CALL lmp%command('compute COM all com')
      COM = lmp%extract_compute('COM', lmp%style%global, lmp%style%type)

   will bind the variable *COM* to the center of mass of the atoms created in
   your simulation. The vector in this case has length 3; the length (or, in
   the case of array data, the number of rows and columns) is determined for
   you based on data from the :cpp:class:`Compute` class.

   .. admonition:: Array index order

      Two-dimensional arrays returned from :f:func:`extract_compute` will be
      **transposed** from equivalent arrays in C, and they will be indexed
      from 1 instead of 0. See the note at :f:func:`extract_atom` for
      further details.

    have dimension ":,:".
   :rtype pointer: polymorphic

   .. note::

      If the compute's data are not already computed for the current step, the
      compute will be invoked. LAMMPS cannot easily check at that time if it is
      valid to invoke a compute, so it may fail with an error. The caller has
      to check to avoid such an error.

   .. warning::

      The pointers returned by this function are generally not persistent,
      since the computed data may be re-distributed, re-allocated, and
      re-ordered at every invocation. It is advisable to re-invoke this
      function before the data are accessed or make a copy if the data are to
      be used after other LAMMPS commands have been issued. Do **not** modify
      the data returned by this function.

--------

.. f:function:: extract_fix(id, style, type[, nrow][, ncol])

   This function calls :cpp:func:`lammps_extract_fix` and returns a pointer to
   LAMMPS data tied to the :cpp:class:`Fix` class, specifically data provided
   by the fix identified by *id*. Fixes may provide global, per-atom, or
   local data, and those data may be a scalar, a vector, or an array. Since
   many fixes provide multiple kinds of data, the user is required to specify
   which set of data is to be returned through the *style* and *type*
   variables.

   .. versionadded:: 3Nov2022

   Global data are calculated at the time they are requested and are only
   available element-by-element. As such, the user is expected to provide
   the *nrow* variable to specify which element of a global vector or the
   *nrow* and *ncol* variables to specify which element of a global array the
   user wishes LAMMPS to return. The *ncol* variable is optional for global
   scalar or vector data, and both *nrow* and *ncol* are optional when a

   In the case of global data, this function returns a value of type
   ``REAL(c_double)``. For per-atom or local data, this function does not
   return a value but instead associates the pointer on the left side of the
   assignment to point to internal LAMMPS data. Pointers must be of the correct
   type and kind to point to said data (i.e., ``REAL(c_double)``) and have
   compatible rank.  The pointer being associated with LAMMPS data is type-,
   kind-, and rank-checked at run-time via an overloaded assignment operator.

   For example,

   .. code-block:: fortran

      TYPE(lammps) :: lmp
      REAL(c_double) :: dr, dx, dy, dz
      ! more code to set up, etc.
      lmp%command('fix george all recenter 2 2 2')
      ! more code
      dr = lmp%extract_fix("george", lmp%style%global, lmp%style%scalar)
      dx = lmp%extract_fix("george", lmp%style%global, lmp%style%vector, 1)
      dy = lmp%extract_fix("george", lmp%style%global, lmp%style%vector, 2)
      dz = lmp%extract_fix("george", lmp%style%global, lmp%style%vector, 3)

   will extract the global scalar calculated by
   :doc:`fix recenter <fix_recenter>` into the variable *dr* and the
   three elements of the global vector calculated by fix recenter into the
   variables *dx*, *dy*, and *dz*, respectively.

   If asked for per-atom or local data, :f:func:`extract_compute` returns a
   pointer to actual LAMMPS data. The pointer so returned will have the
   appropriate size to match the internal data, and will be
   type/kind/rank-checked at the time of the assignment. For example,

   .. code-block:: fortran

      TYPE(lammps) :: lmp
      REAL(c_double), DIMENSION(:), POINTER :: r
      ! more code to set up, etc.

      ! more code
      r = lmp%extract_fix('state', lmp%style%atom, lmp%type%array)

   will bind the pointer *r* to internal LAMMPS data representing the per-atom
   array computed by :doc:`fix store/state <fix_store_state>` when three
   inputs are specified. Similarly,

   .. code-block:: fortran

      TYPE(lammps) :: lmp
      REAL(c_double), DIMENSION(:), POINTER :: x
      ! more code to set up, etc.
      lmp%command('fix state all store/state 0 x')
      ! more code
      x = lmp%extract_fix('state', lmp%style%atom, lmp%type%vector)

   will associate the pointer *x* with internal LAMMPS data corresponding to
   the per-atom vector computed by :doc:`fix store/state <fix_store_state>`
   when only one input is specified. Similar examples with ``lmp%style%atom``
   replaced by ``lmp%style%local`` will extract local data from fixes that
   define local vectors and/or arrays.

   .. warning::

      The pointers returned by this function for per-atom or local data are
      generally not persistent, since the computed data may be redistributed,
      reallocated, and reordered at every invocation of the fix.  It is thus
      advisable to re-invoke this function before the data are accessed or to
      make a copy if the data are to be used after other LAMMPS commands have
      been issued.

   .. note::

      LAMMPS cannot easily check if it is valid to access the data, so it
      may fail with an error.  The caller has to avoid such an error.

   :p character(len=\*) id: string with the name of the fix from which
    to extract data
   :p integer(c_int) style: value indicating the style of data to extract

   :to: :cpp:func:`lammps_extract_fix`
   :r data: LAMMPS data (for global data) or a pointer to LAMMPS data
    (for per-atom or local data). The left-hand side of the assignment should
    be of type ``REAL(c_double)`` and have appropriate rank (i.e.,
    ``DIMENSION(:)`` if expecting per-atom or local vector data and
    ``DIMENSION(:,:)`` if expecting per-atom or local array data). If expecting
    local or per-atom data, it should have the ``POINTER`` attribute, but
    if expecting global data, it should be an ordinary (non-``POINTER``)
    variable.
   :rtype data: polymorphic

   .. admonition:: Array index order

      Two-dimensional global, per-atom, or local array data from
      :f:func:`extract_fix` will be **transposed** from equivalent arrays in
      C (or in the ordinary LAMMPS interface accessed through thermodynamic
      output), and they will be indexed from 1, not 0. This is true even for
      global data, which are returned as scalars---this is done primarily so
      the interface is consistent, as there is no choice but to transpose the
      indices for per-atom or local array data. See the similar note under
      :f:func:`extract_atom` for further details.

--------

.. f:function:: extract_variable(name[,group])

   This function calls :cpp:func:`lammps_extract_variable` and returns a
   scalar, vector, or string containing the value of the variable identified by
   *name*. When the variable is an *equal*-style variable (or one compatible
   with that style such as *internal*), the variable is evaluated and the
   corresponding value returned. When the variable is an *atom*-style variable,
   the variable is evaluated and a vector of values is returned. With all
   other variables, a string is returned. The *group* argument is only used
   for *atom* style variables and is ignored otherwise. If *group* is absent
   for *atom*-style variables, the group is assumed to be "all".

   .. versionadded:: 3Nov2022

   This function returns the values of the variables, not pointers to them.
   Vectors pointing to *atom*-style variables should be of type
   ``REAL(c_double)``, be of rank 1 (i.e., ``DIMENSION(:)``), and have the
   ``ALLOCATABLE`` attribute.

   .. note::

      Unlike the C library interface, the Fortran interface does not require
      you to deallocate memory when you are through; this is done for you,
      behind the scenes.

   For example,

   .. code-block:: fortran

      TYPE(lammps) :: lmp
      REAL(c_double) :: area
      ! more code to set up, etc.
      lmp%command('variable A equal lx*ly')
      ! more code
      area = lmp%extract_variable("A")

   will extract the *x*\ --*y* cross-sectional area of the simulation into the
   variable *area*.

   :p character(len=\*) name: variable name to evaluate
   :o character(len=\*) group [optional]: group for which to extract per-atom
    data (if absent, use "all")
   :to: :cpp:func:`lammps_extract_variable`
   :r data: scalar of type ``REAL(c_double)`` (for *equal*-style
    variables and others that are *equal*-compatible), vector of type
    ``REAL(c_double), DIMENSION(:), ALLOCATABLE`` for *atom*- or *vector*-style
    variables, or ``CHARACTER(LEN=*)`` for *string*-style and compatible
    variables. Strings whose length is too short to hold the result will be
    truncated. Allocatable strings must be allocated before this function is
    called; see note at :f:func:`extract_global` regarding allocatable strings.
    Allocatable arrays (for *atom*- and *vector*-style data) will be
    reallocated on assignment.
   :rtype data: polymorphic

.. note::

   LAMMPS cannot easily check if it is valid to access the data
   referenced by the variables (e.g., computes, fixes, or thermodynamic
   info), so it may fail with an error.  The caller has to make certain
   that the data are extracted only when it is safe to evaluate the variable
   and thus an error and crash are avoided.

   ID, which requires consecutive atom IDs (1 to *natoms*).

   of atoms, see :f:func:`gather_atoms_subset`.

   The *data* array will be ordered in groups of *count* values, sorted by atom
   ID (e.g., if *name* is *x* and *count* = 3, then *data* = [*x*\ (1,1),
   *x*\ (2,1), *x*\ (3,1), *x*\ (1,2), *x*\ (2,2), *x*\ (3,2), *x*\ (1,3),

   This function is not compatible with ``-DLAMMPS_BIGBIG``.

   :p character(len=\*) name: desired quantity (e.g., *x* or *mask*)
   :p integer(c_int) count: number of per-atom values you expect per atom

    *count* = 3 with *image* if you want a single image flag unpacked into
    *x*/*y*/*z* components.
   :p data: array into which to store
    the data. Array *must* have the ``ALLOCATABLE`` attribute and be of rank 1
    (i.e., ``DIMENSION(:)``). If this array is already allocated, it will be

    expecting floating-point data.

      If you want data from this function to be accessible as a two-dimensional

      .. code-block:: fortran

         USE, INTRINSIC :: ISO_C_BINDING
         USE LIBLAMMPS
         TYPE(lammps) :: lmp

         CALL lmp%gather_atoms('x',3,xdata)
         x(1:3,1:size(xdata)/3) => xdata

   This subroutine takes data stored in a one-dimensional array supplied by the

   Use :f:func:`scatter_atoms_subset` to scatter data for some (or all)

   that the IDs be consecutive, as they are provided in a separate array,
   *ids*. Use :f:func:`scatter_atoms` to scatter data for all atoms, in order.

   The *data* array needs to be organized in groups of 1 or 3 values,
   depending on which quantity is being scattered, with the groups in the same
   order as the array *ids*. For example, if you want *data* to be the array

.. f:subroutine:: gather_impropers(data)

   Gather type and constituent atom information for all impropers.

   .. versionadded:: 8Feb2023

   This function copies the list of all impropers into an allocatable array.
   The array will be filled with (improper type, improper atom 1, improper atom 2,
   improper atom 3, improper atom 4) for each improper. The array is allocated to
   the right length (i.e., five times the number of impropers).
   The array *data* must be of the same type as the LAMMPS
   ``tagint`` type, which is equivalent to either ``INTEGER(c_int)`` or
   ``INTEGER(c_int64_t)``, depending on whether ``-DLAMMPS_BIGBIG`` was used
   when LAMMPS was built. If the supplied array does not match, an error will
   result at run-time.

   An example of how to use this routine is below:

   .. versionadded:: 22Dec2022

   This subroutine gathers data for all atoms and stores them in a
   one-dimensional allocatable array. The data will be a
   concatenation of chunks from each processor's owned atoms, in whatever order
   the atoms are in on each processor. This process has no requirement that the
   atom IDs be consecutive. If you need the ID of each atom, you can do another
   call to either :f:subr:`gather_atoms_concat` or :f:subr:`gather_concat` with
   *name* set to ``id``. If you have consecutive IDs and want the data to be in
   order, use :f:subr:`gather`; for a similar array but for a subset of
   atoms, use :f:subr:`gather_subset`.

   The *data* array will be in groups of *count* values, with *natoms* groups
   total, but not in order by atom ID (e.g., if *name* is *x* and *count* is 3,
   then *data* might be something like [x(1,11), x(2,11), x(3,11), x(1,3),

   there is no requirement that the IDs be consecutive. If you wish to return a
   similar array for *all* the atoms, use :f:subr:`gather` or
   :f:subr:`gather_concat`.

   The *data* array will be in groups of *count* values, sorted by atom ID in
   the same order as the array *ids* (e.g., if *name* is *x*, *count* = 3, and
   *ids* is [100, 57, 210], then *data* might look like [*x*\ (1,100),
   *x*\ (2,100), *x*\ (3,100), *x*\ (1,57), *x*\ (2,57), *x*\ (3,57),

   :p data: per-atom values packed into a one-dimensional array containing the

    and will be allocated either to the same length as *ids*
    (for *mask*, *type*, etc.) or to three times its length (for *x*, *f*,
    etc.); the array must be rank 1 and be of type ``INTEGER(c_int)`` (e.g.,

   .. note::

      The *type* and *x* arguments are required, but they are declared

      When LAMMPS has been compiled with ``-DLAMMPS_BIGBIG``, it is not
      possible to include the *image* parameter but omit the *id* parameter.
      Either *id* must be present, or both *id* and *image* must be absent.
      This is required because having all arguments be optional in both
      generic functions creates an ambiguous interface. This limitation does
      not exist if LAMMPS was not compiled with ``-DLAMMPS_BIGBIG``.

   Find index of a neighbor list requested by a pair style.

   This function determines which of the available neighbor lists for pair
   styles matches the given conditions.  It first matches the style name.
   If *exact* is ``.TRUE.``, the name must match exactly; if ``.FALSE.``, a
   regular expression or sub-string match is done.  If the pair style is
   *hybrid* or *hybrid/overlay*, the style is matched against the sub-styles
   instead. If the same pair style is used multiple times as a sub-style, the
   *nsub* argument must be :math:`> 0`; this argument represents the *n*\ th
   instance of the sub-style (same as for the :doc:`pair_coeff <pair_coeff>`
   command, for example). In that case, *nsub*\ :math:`{} = 0` will not
   produce a match, and the function will return :math:`-1`.

   The final condition to be checked is the request ID (\ *reqid*\ ). This
   will usually be zero, but some pair styles request multiple neighbor
   lists and set the request ID to a value greater than zero.

   This function checks if exceptions were enabled.

   When using the library interface with C++ exceptions enabled, the library

   .. versionadded:: 3Nov2022

   This function calls :cpp:func:`lammps_style_name` and copies the name of
   the *category* style with index *idx* into the provided string *buffer*.
   The length of *buffer* must be long enough to contain the name of the
   style; if it is too short, the name will be truncated accordingly.

   This function copies the name of the *style* plugin with the index *idx*
   into the provided C-style string buffer.  The length of the buffer must be
   provided as *buf_size* argument.  If the name of the style exceeds the

--------

.. f:function:: encode_image_flags(ix, iy, iz)

   Encodes three integer image flags into a single imageint.

   .. versionadded:: 3Nov2022

   This function performs the bit-shift, addition, and bit-wise OR operations
   necessary to combine the values of three integers representing the image
   flags in the :math:`x`-, :math:`y`-, and :math:`z`-directions. Unless LAMMPS
   is compiled with ``-DLAMMPS_BIGBIG``, those integers are limited to 10-bit
   signed integers :math:`[-512,512)`. If ``-DLAMMPS_BIGBIG`` was used when
   compiling, then the return value is of kind ``c_int64_t`` instead of
   kind ``c_int``, and the valid range for the individual image flags becomes
   :math:`[-1048576,1048575)` (i.e., the range of a 21-bit signed integer).
   There is no check on whether the arguments conform to these requirements;
   values out of range will simply be wrapped back into the interval.

   :p integer(c_int) ix: image flag in :math:`x`-direction
   :p integer(c_int) iy: image flag in :math:`y`-direction
   :p integer(c_int) iz: image flag in :math:`z`-direction
   :r integer(kind=\*) imageint: encoded image flag. \*The ``KIND`` parameter
    is ``c_int`` unless LAMMPS was built with ``-DLAMMPS_BIGBIG``, in which
    case it is ``c_int64_t``.

   .. note::

     The fact that the programmer does not know the ``KIND`` parameter of the
     return value until compile time means that it is impossible to define an
     interface that works for both sizes of ``imageint``. One side effect of
     this is that you must assign the return value of this function to a
     variable; it cannot be used as the argument to another function or as part
     of an array constructor. For example,

     .. code-block:: fortran

        my_images = [lmp%encode_image_flags(0,0,0), lmp%encode_image_flags(1,0,0)]

     will *not* work; instead, do something like

     .. code-block:: fortran

        my_images(1) = lmp%encode_image_flags(0,0,0)
        my_images(2) = lmp%encode_image_flags(1,0,0)

--------

.. f:subroutine:: decode_image_flags(image, flags)

   This function does the reverse operation of :f:func:`encode_image_flags`:
   it takes the image flag and performs the bit-shift and bit-masking
   operations to decode it and stores the resulting three integers into the
   array *flags*.

   .. versionadded:: 3Nov2022

   :p integer(kind=\*) image: encoded image flag. \*The ``KIND`` parameter is
    either ``c_int`` or, if LAMMPS was compiled with ``-DLAMMPS_BIGBIG``,
    ``c_int64_t``. Kind compatibility is checked at run-time.
   :p integer(c_int) flags [dimension(3)]: three-element vector where the
    decoded image flags will be stored.

--------

.. f:subroutine:: set_fix_external_callback(id, callback, caller)

   Set the callback function for a :doc:`fix external <fix_external>` instance
   with the given ID.

   .. versionadded:: 22Dec2022

   Fix :doc:`external <fix_external>` allows programs that are running LAMMPS
   through its library interface to modify certain LAMMPS properties on
   specific time steps, similar to the way other fixes do.

   This subroutine sets the callback function for use with the "pf/callback"
   mode. The function should have Fortran language bindings with the following
   interface, which depends on how LAMMPS was compiled:

   .. code-block:: fortran

      ABSTRACT INTERFACE
        SUBROUTINE external_callback(caller, timestep, ids, x, fexternal)
          USE, INTRINSIC :: ISO_C_BINDING, ONLY : c_int, c_double, c_int64_t
          CLASS(*), INTENT(INOUT) :: caller
          INTEGER(c_bigint), INTENT(IN) :: timestep
          INTEGER(c_tagint), DIMENSION(:), INTENT(IN) :: ids
          REAL(c_double), DIMENSION(:,:), INTENT(IN) :: x
          REAL(c_double), DIMENSION(:,:), INTENT(OUT) :: fexternal
        END SUBROUTINE external_callback
      END INTERFACE

   where ``c_bigint`` is ``c_int`` if ``-DLAMMPS_SMALLSMALL`` was used and
   ``c_int64_t`` otherwise; and ``c_tagint`` is ``c_int64_t`` if
   ``-DLAMMPS_BIGBIG`` was used and ``c_int`` otherwise.

   The argument *caller* to :f:subr:`set_fix_external_callback` is unlimited
   polymorphic (i.e., it can be any Fortran object you want to pass to the
   calling function) and will be available as the first argument to the
   callback function. It can be your LAMMPS instance, which you might need if
   the callback function needs access to the library interface.
   The argument must be a scalar; to pass non-scalar data, wrap those data in
   a derived type and pass an instance of the derived type to *caller*.

   The array *ids* is an array of length *nlocal* (as accessed from the
   :cpp:class:`Atom` class or through :f:func:`extract_global`). The arrays
   *x* and *fexternal* are :math:`3 \times {}`\ *nlocal* arrays; these are
   transposed from what they would look like in C (see note about array index
   order at :f:func:`extract_atom`).

   The callback mechanism is one of two ways that forces can be applied to a
   simulation with the help of :doc:`fix external <fix_external>`. The
   alternative is *array* mode, where one calls
   :f:func:`fix_external_get_force`.

   Please see the documentation for :doc:`fix external <fix_external>` for
   more information about how to use the fix and couple it with external
   programs.

   :p character(len=*) id: ID of :doc:`fix external <fix_external>` instance
   :p callback: subroutine :doc:`fix external <fix_external>` should call
   :ptype callback: external
   :p class(*) caller [optional]: object you wish to pass to the callback
    procedure (must be a scalar; see note)
   :to: :cpp:func:`lammps_set_fix_external_callback`

   .. note::

      The interface for your callback function must match types precisely
      with the abstract interface block given above. **The compiler probably
      will not be able to check this for you.** In particular, the first
      argument ("caller") must be of type ``CLASS(*)`` or you will probably
      get a segmentation fault or at least a misinterpretation of whatever is
      in memory there. You can resolve the object using the ``SELECT TYPE``
      construct. An example callback function (assuming LAMMPS was compiled
      with ``-DLAMMPS_SMALLBIG``) that applies something akin to Hooke's Law
      (with each atom having a different *k* value) is shown below.

      .. code-block:: fortran

         MODULE stuff
           USE, INTRINSIC :: ISO_C_BINDING, ONLY : c_int, c_double, c_int64_t
           USE, INTRINSIC :: ISO_FORTRAN_ENV, ONLY : error_unit
           IMPLICIT NONE

           TYPE shield
              REAL(c_double), DIMENSION(:,:), ALLOCATABLE :: k
              ! assume k gets allocated to dimension(3,nlocal) at some point
              ! and assigned values
           END TYPE shield

           SUBROUTINE my_callback(caller, timestep, ids, x, fexternal)
             CLASS(*), INTENT(INOUT) :: caller
             INTEGER(c_int), INTENT(IN) :: timestep
             INTEGER(c_int64_t), INTENT(IN) :: ids
             REAL(c_double), INTENT(IN) :: x(:,:)
             REAL(c_double), INTENT(OUT) :: fexternal(:,:)

             SELECT TYPE (caller)
               TYPE IS (shield)
                  fexternal = - caller%k * x
               CLASS DEFAULT
                  WRITE(error_unit,*) 'UH OH...'
             END SELECT
           END SUBROUTINE my_callback
         END MODULE stuff

         ! then, when assigning the callback function, do this:
         PROGRAM example
           USE LIBLAMMPS
           USE stuff
           TYPE(lammps) :: lmp
           TYPE(shield) :: my_shield
           lmp = lammps()
           CALL lmp%command('fix ext all external pf/callback 1 1')
           CALL lmp%set_fix_external_callback('ext', my_callback, my_shield)
         END PROGRAM example

--------

.. f:function:: fix_external_get_force(id)

   Get pointer to the force array storage in a fix external instance with the
   given ID.

   .. versionadded:: 22Dec2022

   Fix :doc:`external <fix_external>` allows programs that are running LAMMPS
   through its library interfaces to add or modify certain LAMMPS properties on
   specific time steps, similar to the way other fixes do.

   This function provides access to the per-atom force storage in a fix
   external instance with the given fix-ID to be added to the individual
   atoms when using the "pf/array" mode.  The *fexternal* array can be
   accessed like other "native" per-atom arrays accessible via the
   :f:func:`extract_atom` function.  Please note that the array
   stores the forces for *local* atoms for each MPI rank, in the order
   determined by the neighbor list build.  Because the underlying data
   structures can change as well as the order of atom as they migrate between
   MPI processes because of the domain decomposition parallelization, this
   function should be always called immediately before the forces are going to
   be set to get an up-to-date pointer.  You can use, for example,
   :f:func:`extract_setting` to obtain the number of local atoms `nlocal` and
   then assume the dimensions of the returned force array as
   ``REAL(c_double) :: force(3,nlocal)``.

   This function is an alternative to the callback mechanism in fix external
   set up by :f:subr:`set_fix_external_callback`. The main difference is that
   this mechanism can be used when forces are to be pre-computed and the
   control alternates between LAMMPS and the external driver, while the
   callback mechanism can call an external subroutine to compute the force when
   the fix is triggered and needs them.

   Please see the documentation for :doc:`fix external <fix_external>` for
   more information about how to use the fix and how to couple it with an
   external program.

   :p character(len=*) id: ID of :doc:`fix external <fix_external>` instance

--------

.. f:subroutine:: fix_external_set_energy_global(id, eng)

   Set the global energy contribution for a :doc:`fix external <fix_external>`
   instance with the given ID.

   .. versionadded:: 22Dec2022

   This is a companion function to :f:func:`set_fix_external_callback`
   and :f:func:`fix_external_get_force` that also sets the contribution to the
   global energy from the external program.  The value of the *eng* argument
   will be stored in the fix and applied on the current and all following
   time steps until changed by another call to this function. The energy is in
   energy units as determined by the current :doc:`units <units>` settings and
   is the **total** energy of the contribution.  Thus, when running in
   parallel, all MPI processes have to call this function with the **same**
   value, and this will be returned as a scalar property of the fix external
   instance when accessed in LAMMPS input commands or from variables.

   Please see the documentation for :doc:`fix external <fix_external>` for more
   information about how to use the fix and how to couple it with an external
   program.

.. f:subroutine:: fix_external_set_virial_global(id, virial)

   Set the global virial contribution for a fix external instance with the
   given ID.

   .. versionadded:: 22Dec2022

   This is a companion function to :f:subr:`set_fix_external_callback`
   and :f:func:`fix_external_get_force` to set the contribution to the global
   virial from an external program.

   The six values of the *virial* array will be stored in the fix and applied
   on the current and all following time steps until changed by another call
   to this function. The components of the virial need to be stored in the
   following order: *xx*, *yy*, *zz*, *xy*, *xz*, *yz*.  In LAMMPS, the virial
   is stored internally as `stress*volume` in units of `pressure*volume` as
   determined by the current :doc:`units <units>` settings and is the
   **total** contribution.  Thus, when running in parallel, all MPI processes
   have to call this function with the **same** value, and this will then be
   added by fix external.

   Please see the documentation for :doc:`fix external <fix_external>` for
   more information about how to use the fix and how to couple it with an
   external code.

.. f:subroutine:: fix_external_set_energy_peratom(id, eng)

   Set the per-atom energy contribution for a fix external instance with the
   given ID.

   .. versionadded:: 22Dec2022

   This is a companion function to :f:subr:`set_fix_external_callback` to set
   the per-atom energy contribution due to the fix from the external program as
   part of the callback function.  For this to work, the LAMMPS object must be
   passed as part of the *caller* argument when registering the callback
   function, or the callback function must otherwise have access to the
   LAMMPS object, such as through a module-based pointer.

   .. note::

      This function is fully independent from
      :f:subr:`fix_external_set_energy_global` and will **NOT** add any
      contributions to the global energy tally and will **NOT** check whether
      the sum of the contributions added here are consistent with the global
      added energy.

   Please see the documentation for :doc:`fix external <fix_external>` for
   more information about how to use the fix and how to couple it with an
   external code.

.. f:subroutine:: set_fix_external_set_virial_peratom(id, virial)

   This is a companion function to :f:subr:`set_fix_external_callback` to set
   the per-atom virial contribution due to the fix from the external program as
   part of the callback function.  For this to work, the LAMMPS object must be
   passed as the *caller* argument when registering the callback function.

   .. versionadded:: 22Dec2022

      sum of the contributions added here are consistent with the global added
      virial.

   The order and units of the per-atom stress tensor elements are the same
   as for the global virial.  The type and dimensions of the per-atom virial
   array must be ``REAL(c_double), DIMENSION(6,nlocal)``.

   :f:func:`fix_external_get_force` to set the length of a global vector of
   properties that will be stored with the fix via
   :f:subr:`fix_external_set_vector`.

   This function needs to be called **before** a call to
   :f:subr:`fix_external_set_vector` and **before** a run or minimize command.
   When running in parallel, it must be called from **all** MPI
   processes with the same length argument.

   Please see the documentation for :doc:`fix external <fix_external>` for
   more information about how to use the fix and how to couple it with an
   external program.

   :p character(len=*) id: fix ID of fix external instance
   :p integer(c_int) length: length of the global vector to be stored with the
    fix
   :to: :cpp:func:`lammps_fix_external_set_vector_length`

--------

.. f:subroutine:: fix_external_set_vector(id, idx, val)

   Store a global vector value for a fix external instance with the given ID.

   .. versionadded:: 22Dec2022

   This is a companion function to :f:subr:`set_fix_external_callback` and
   :f:func:`fix_external_get_force` to set the values of a global vector of
   properties that will be stored with the fix and can be accessed from
   within LAMMPS input commands (e.g., fix ave/time or variables) when used
   in a vector context.

   This function needs to be called **after** a call to
   :f:subr:`fix_external_set_vector_length` and **before** a run or minimize
   command.  When running in parallel, it must be called from **all** MPI
   processes with the **same** *idx* and *val* parameters.  The variable
   *val* is assumed to be extensive.

   .. note::

      The index in the *idx* parameter is 1-based (i.e., the first element
      is set with *idx*\ :math:`{} = 1`, and the last element of the vector
      with *idx*\ :math:`{} = N`, where :math:`N` is the value of the *length*
      parameter of the call to :f:subr:`fix_external_set_vector_length`).

   Please see the documentation for :doc:`fix external <fix_external>` for
   more information about how to use the fix and how to couple it with an
   external code.

   :p character(len=*) id: ID of fix external instance
   :p integer(c_int) idx: 1-based index in global vector
   :p integer(c_int) val: value to be stored in global vector at index *idx*
   :to: :cpp:func:`lammps_fix_external_set_vector`

--------

.. f:subroutine:: flush_buffers()

   This function calls :cpp:func:`lammps_flush_buffers`, which flushes buffered
   output to be written to screen and logfile. This can simplify capturing
   output from LAMMPS library calls.

   .. versionadded:: 3Nov2022

   :to: :cpp:func:`lammps_flush_buffers`

--------

.. f:function:: is_running()

   Check if LAMMPS is currently inside a run or minimization.

   .. versionadded:: 3Nov2022

   This function can be used from signal handlers or multi-threaded
   applications to determine if the LAMMPS instance is currently active.

   :to: :cpp:func:`lammps_is_running`
   :r is_running: ``.FALSE.`` if idle or ``.TRUE.`` if active
   :rtype is_running: logical

--------

.. f:subroutine:: force_timeout()

   Force a timeout to stop an ongoing run cleanly.

   .. versionadded:: 3Nov2022

   This function can be used from signal handlers or multi-threaded
   applications to terminate an ongoing run cleanly.

   :to: :cpp:func:`lammps_force_timeout`

--------

.. f:function:: has_error()

   Check if there is a (new) error message available.

   .. versionadded:: 3Nov2022

   This function can be used to query if an error inside of LAMMPS
   has thrown a :ref:`C++ exception <exceptions>`.

   .. note::

      This function will always report "no error" when the LAMMPS library
      has been compiled without ``-DLAMMPS_EXCEPTIONS``, which turns fatal
      errors aborting LAMMPS into C++ exceptions. You can use the library
      function :cpp:func:`lammps_config_has_exceptions` to check if this is
      the case.

   :to: :cpp:func:`lammps_has_error`
   :r has_error: ``.TRUE.`` if there is an error.
   :rtype has_error: logical

--------

.. f:subroutine:: get_last_error_message(buffer[,status])

   Copy the last error message into the provided buffer.

   .. versionadded:: 3Nov2022

   This function can be used to retrieve the error message that was set
   in the event of an error inside of LAMMPS that resulted in a
   :ref:`C++ exception <exceptions>`.  A suitable buffer for a string has
   to be provided.  If the internally-stored error message is longer than the
   string, it will be truncated accordingly.  The optional argument *status*
   indicates the kind of error: a "1" indicates an error that occurred on all
   MPI ranks and is often recoverable, while a "2" indicates an abort that
   would happen only in a single MPI rank and thus may not be recoverable, as
   other MPI ranks may be waiting on the failing MPI rank(s) to send messages.

   .. note::

      This function will do nothing when the LAMMPS library has been
      compiled without ``-DLAMMPS_EXCEPTIONS``, which turns errors aborting
      LAMMPS into C++ exceptions.  You can use the function
      :f:func:`config_has_exceptions` to check whether this is the case.

   :p character(len=\*) buffer: string buffer to copy the error message into
   :o integer(c_int) status [optional]: 1 when all ranks had the error,
    2 on a single-rank error.
