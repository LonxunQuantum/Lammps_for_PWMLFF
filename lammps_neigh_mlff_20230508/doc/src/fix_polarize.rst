Description
"""""""""""

These fixes compute induced charges at the interface between two
impermeable media with different dielectric constants. The interfaces
need to be discretized into vertices, each representing a boundary
element.  The vertices are treated as if they were regular atoms or
particles.  :doc:`atom_style dielectric <atom_style>` should be used
since it defines the additional properties of each interface particle
such as interface normal vectors, element areas, and local dielectric
mismatch.  These fixes also require the use of :doc:`pair_style
<pair_style>` and :doc:`kspace_style <kspace_style>` with the
*dielectric* suffix.  At every time step, given a configuration of the
physical charges in the system (such as atoms and charged particles)
these fixes compute and update the charge of the interface
particles. The interfaces are allowed to move during the simulation if
the appropriate time integrators are also set (for example, with
:doc:`fix_rigid <fix_rigid>`).

Consider an interface between two media: one with dielectric constant of
78 (water), the other of 4 (silica). The interface is discretized into
2000 boundary elements, each represented by an interface
particle. Suppose that each interface particle has a normal unit vector
pointing from the silica medium to water.  The dielectric difference
along the normal vector is then 78 - 4 = 74, the mean dielectric value
is (78 + 4) / 2 = 41. Each boundary element also has its area and the
local mean curvature, which is used by these fixes for computing a
correction term in the local electric field.  To model charged
interfaces, the interface particle will have a non-zero charge value,
coming from its area and surface charge density.

For non-interface particles such as atoms and charged particles, the
interface normal vectors, element area, and dielectric mismatch are
irrelevant and unused. Their local dielectric value is used internally
to rescale their given charge when computing the Coulombic
interactions. For instance, to simulate a cation carrying a charge of +2
(in simulation charge units) in an implicit solvent with a dielectric
constant of 40, the cation's charge should be set to +2 and its local
dielectric constant property (defined in the :doc:`atom_style dielectric
<atom_style>`) should be set to 40; there is no need to manually rescale
charge. This will produce the proper force for any :doc:`pair_style
<pair_style>` with the dielectric suffix.  It is assumed that the
particles cannot pass through the interface during the simulation
because the value of the local dielectric constant property does not
change.

There are some example scripts for using these fixes with LAMMPS in the
``examples/PACKAGES/dielectric`` directory. The README file therein
contains specific details on the system setup. Note that the example
data files show the additional fields (columns) needed for
:doc:`atom_style dielectric <atom_style>` beyond the conventional fields
*id*, *mol*, *type*, *q*, *x*, *y*, and *z*.

----------

For fix *polarize/bem/gmres* and fix *polarize/bem/icc* the induced
charges of the atoms in the specified group, which are the vertices on
the interface, are computed using the equation:

.. math::

  \sigma_b(\mathbf{s}) = \dfrac{1 - \bar{\epsilon}}{\bar{\epsilon}}
     \sigma_f(\mathbf{s}) - \epsilon_0 \dfrac{\Delta \epsilon}{\bar{\epsilon}}
     \mathbf{E}(\mathbf{s}) \cdot \mathbf{n}(\mathbf{s})

* :math:`\sigma_b` is the induced charge density at the interface vertex :math:`\mathbf{s}`.
* :math:`\bar{\epsilon}` is the mean dielectric constant at the interface vertex: :math:`\bar{\epsilon} = (\epsilon_1 + \epsilon_2)/2`.
* :math:`\Delta \epsilon` is the dielectric constant difference at the interface vertex: :math:`\Delta \epsilon = \epsilon_1 - \epsilon_2`
* :math:`\sigma_f` is the free charge density at the interface vertex
* :math:`\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{s})` is the electrical field at the vertex
* :math:`\mathbf{n}(\mathbf{s})` is the unit normal vector at the vertex pointing from medium with :math:`\epsilon_2` to that with :math:`\epsilon_1`

Fix *polarize/bem/gmres* employs the Generalized Minimum Residual
(GMRES) as described in :ref:`(Barros) <Barros>` to solve
:math:`\sigma_b`.

Fix *polarize/bem/icc* employs the successive over-relaxation algorithm
as described in :ref:`(Tyagi) <Tyagi>` to solve :math:`\sigma_b`.

The iterative solvers would terminate either when the maximum relative
change in the induced charges in consecutive iterations is below the set
tolerance, or when the number of iterations reaches *iter_max* (see
below).

Fix *polarize/functional* employs the energy functional variation
approach as described in :ref:`(Jadhao) <Jadhao>` to solve
:math:`\sigma_b`.

More details on the implementation of these fixes and their recommended
use are described in :ref:`(NguyenTD) <NguyenTD>`.


Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

No information about this fix is written to :doc:`binary restart files <restart>`.

The :doc:`fix_modify <fix_modify>` command provides the ability to modify certain
settings:

  .. parsed-literal::
      *itr_max* arg
         arg = maximum number of iterations for convergence
      *dielectrics* ediff emean epsilon area charge
         ediff = dielectric difference or NULL
         emean = dielectric mean or NULL
         epsilon = local dielectric value or NULL
         area = element area or NULL
         charge = real interface charge or NULL
      *kspace* arg = yes or no
      *rand* max seed
         max = range of random induced charges to be generated
         seed = random number seed to use when generating random charge
      *mr* arg
         arg = maximum number of q-vectors to use when solving (GMRES only)
      *omega* arg
         arg = relaxation parameter to use when iterating (ICC only)

The *itr_max* keyword sets the max number of iterations to be used for
solving each step.

The *dielectrics* keyword allows properties of the atoms in group
*group-ID* to be modified. Values passed to any of the arguments
(*ediff*, *emean*, *epsilon*, *area*, *charge*) will override existing
values for all atoms in the group *group-ID*. Passing NULL to any of
these arguments will preserve the existing value. Note that setting the
properties of the interface this way will change the properties of all
atoms associated with the fix (all atoms in *group-ID*), so multiple fix
and fix_modify commands would be needed to change the properties of two
different interfaces to different values (one fix and fix_modify for
each interface group).

The *kspace* keyword turns on long range interactions.

If the arguments of the *rand* keyword are set, then the atoms subject
to this fix will be assigned a random initial charge in a uniform
distribution from -*max*/2 to *max*/2, using random number seed *seed*.

The *mr* keyword only applies to *style* = *polarize/bem/gmres*. It is
the maximum number of q-vectors to use when solving for the surface
charge.

The *omega* keyword only applies when using *style* =
*polarize/bem/icc*. It is a relaxation parameter defined in
:ref:`(Tyagi) <Tyagi>` that should generally be set between 0 and 2.

Note that the local dielectric constant (epsilon) can also be set
independently using the :doc:`set <set>` command.

----------

*polarize/bem/gmres* or *polarize/bem/icc* compute a global 2-element
vector which can be accessed by various :doc:`output commands
<Howto_output>`.  The first element is the number of iterations when the
solver terminates (of which the upper bound is set by *iter_max*). The
second element is the RMS error.


Restrictions
""""""""""""

These fixes are part of the DIELECTRIC package.  They are only enabled
if LAMMPS was built with that package, which requires that also the
KSPACE package is installed.  See the :doc:`Build package
<Build_package>` page for more info.

Note that the *polarize/bem/gmres* and *polarize/bem/icc* fixes only
support :doc:`units <units>` *lj*, *real*, *metal*, *si* and *nano* at
the moment.
