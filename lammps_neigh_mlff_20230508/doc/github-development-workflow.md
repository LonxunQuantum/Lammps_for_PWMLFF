# Outline of the GitHub Development Workflow

The purpose of this document is to provide a point of reference for the
core LAMMPS developers and other LAMMPS contributors to understand the
choices the LAMMPS developers have agreed on. Git and GitHub provide the
tools, but do not set policies, so it is up to the developers to come to
an agreement as to how to define and interpret policies. This document
is likely to change as our experiences and needs change, and we try to
adapt it accordingly. Last change 2023-02-10.

## GitHub Merge Management

In the interest of consistency, ONLY ONE of the core LAMMPS developers
should do the merging.  This is currently
[@akohlmey](https://github.com/akohlmey) (Axel Kohlmeyer).  If this
assignment needs to be changed, it shall be done right after a stable
release.  If the currently assigned developer cannot merge outstanding
pull requests in a timely manner, or in other extenuating circumstances,
other core LAMMPS developers with merge permission may merge pull
requests.

## Pull Requests

*ALL* changes to the LAMMPS code and documentation, however trivial,
MUST be submitted as a pull request to GitHub.  All changes to the
"develop" branch must be made exclusively through merging pull requests.
The "release" and "stable" branches, respectively, are only to be
updated upon feature or stable releases based on the associated
tags.  Updates to the stable release in between stable releases
(for example, back-ported bug fixes) are first merged into the "maintenance"
branch and then into the "stable" branch as update releases.

Pull requests may also be submitted to (long-running) feature branches
created by LAMMPS developers inside the LAMMPS project, if needed. Those
are not subject to the merge and review restrictions discussed in this
document, though, but get managed as needed on a case-by-case basis.

### Pull Request Assignments

Pull requests can be "chaperoned" by one of the LAMMPS core developers.
This is indicated by whom the pull request is assigned to.  LAMMPS core
developers can self-assign, or they can decide to assign a pull request
to a different LAMMPS developer. Being assigned to a pull request means,
that this pull request may need some work and the assignee is tasked to
determine whether this might be needed or not. The assignee may either
choose to implement required changes or ask the submitter of the pull
request to implement them.  Even though, all LAMMPS developers may have
write access to pull requests (if enabled by the submitter, which is the
default), only the submitter or the assignee of a pull request should do
so.  During this period, the `work_in_progress` label may be applied to
the pull request.  The assignee gets to decide what happens to the pull
request next, e.g. whether it should be assigned to a different
developer for additional checks and changes, or is recommended to be
merged.  Removing the `work_in_progress` label and assigning the pull
request to the developer tasked with merging signals that a pull request
is ready to be merged. In addition, a `ready_for_merge` label may also
be assigned to signal urgency to merge this pull request quickly.

### Pull Request Reviews

People can be assigned to review a pull request in two ways:

  * They can be assigned manually to review a pull request
    by the submitter or a LAMMPS developer
  * They can be automatically assigned, because a developer's GitHub
    handle matches a file pattern in the `.github/CODEOWNERS` file,
    which associates developers with the code they contributed and
    maintain.

Reviewers are requested to state their appraisal of the proposed changes
and either approve or request changes. People may unassign themselves
from review, if they feel not competent about the changes proposed. At
least two approvals from LAMMPS developers with write access are
required before merging, in addition to passing all automated
compilation and unit tests.  Merging counts as implicit approval, so
does submission of a pull request (by a LAMMPS developer). So the person
doing the merge may not also submit an approving review.  The GitHub
feature, that reviews from code owners are "hard" reviews (i.e. they
must all approve before merging is allowed), is currently disabled.
It is in the discretion of the merge maintainer to assess when a
sufficient degree of approval has been reached, especially from external
collaborators.  Reviews may be (automatically) dismissed, when the
reviewed code has been changed. Review may be requested a second time.

### Pull Request Discussions

All discussions about a pull request should be kept as much as possible
on the pull request discussion page on GitHub, so that other developers
can later review the entire discussion after the fact and understand the
rationale behind choices that were made.  Exceptions to this policy are
technical discussions, that are centered on tools or policies themselves
(git, GitHub, c++) rather than on the content of the pull request.

## GitHub Issues

The GitHub issue tracker is the location where the LAMMPS developers
and other contributors or LAMMPS users can report issues or bugs with
the LAMMPS code or request new features to be added. Bug reports have
a `[Bug]` marker in the subject line; suggestions for changes or
adding new functionality are indicated by a `[Feature Request]`
marker in the subject. This is automatically done when using the
corresponding template for submitting an issue.  Issues may be assigned
to one or more developers, if they are working on this feature or
working to resolve an issue.  Issues that have nobody working
on them at the moment, or in the near future, have the label
`volunteer needed` attached.

When an issue, say `#125` is resolved by a specific pull request, the
comment for the pull request shall contain the text `closes #125` or
`fixes #125`, so that the issue is automatically deleted when the pull
request is merged.  The template for pull requests includes a header
where connections between pull requests and issues can be listed, and
thus where this comment should be placed.

## Milestones and Release Planning

LAMMPS uses a continuous release development model with incremental
changes, i.e. significant effort is made -- including automated pre-merge
testing -- that the code in the branch "develop" does not get easily
broken.  These tests are run after every update to a pull request.  More
extensive and time-consuming tests (including regression testing) are
performed after code is merged to the "develop" branch.  There are feature
releases of LAMMPS made about every 4-6 weeks at a point, when the LAMMPS
developers feel, that a sufficient number of changes has been included
and all post-merge testing has been successful.  These feature releases are
marked with a `patch_<version date>` tag and the "release" branch
follows only these versions with fast-forward merges.  While "develop" may
be temporarily broken through issues only detected by the post-merge tests,
The "release" branch is always supposed to be of production quality.

About once each year, there is a "stable" release of LAMMPS.
These have seen additional, manual testing and review of
results from testing with instrumented code and static code analysis.
Also, the last few feature releases before a stable release are "release
candidate" versions which only contain bug fixes, feature additions to
peripheral functionality, and documentation updates.  In between stable
releases, bug fixes and infrastructure updates are back-ported from the
"develop" branch to the "maintenance" branch and occasionally merged
into "stable" and published as update releases.

For release planning and the information of code contributors, issues
and pull requests being actively worked on are assigned a "milestone",
which corresponds to the next stable release or the stable release after
that, with a tentative release date.
