These input scripts illustrate the use of several commands that
overlay grids on the simulation domain.

fix ave/grid
compute property/grid
dump grid
dump grid/vtk

The in.grid.2d and in.grid.3d scripts model simple Lennard Jones
liquids.  The in.sph script models SPH water flowing over a dam.  All
the scripts use dynamic load balancing to illustrate that the grid
cells can be dynamically partitioned across processors similar to how
particles are.

To produce output dump files and image files, you will need to
uncomment the various "dump" commands that produce them.  The images
show processor subdomains as well as the background grid, colored by
particle counts in each grid cell.
